        "text": "time ago , hillary clinton advisers decided best course action apologize used personal email address conduct government business serving secretary state . clinton , clearly , really remorseful , showed early efforts address . eventually aides prevailed upon express greater degree regret , hoped would lay issue rest . . instead , email related talk dogged clinton throughout election influenced public perceptions overwhelmingly negative way . july polling showed percent americans believed clinton broke law relying personal email address another percent piling say episode showed bad judgments albeit criminality . clinton apologized appear way important , clinton allies , surrogates , co partisans largely familiarized details matter , instead saying vaguely error judgment apologized america bigger fish fry . effect inscribing reinscribing notion clinton something wrong , meaning every bit micro news puts scandal back cable amounts reminding people something bad clinton . total , network newscasts , remarkably , dedicated airtime coverage clinton emails policy issues combined . unfortunate emailgate , like many clinton pseudo scandals , bullshit . real scandal way story best modest significance came dominate us presidential election overwhelming stories much importance , giving american people completely skewed impression one two nominees , creating space fbi intervene election favor apparently preferred candidate dangerous way . hillary clinton used personal email account hillary clinton took office secretary state , , like people , already personal email account . like people started federal job , also disheartened learn current state federal departments could connect personal smartphone state department email address . wanted ready access email accounts , would need carry two smartphones . reporter washington knows , indignity fact visited upon huge number dc denizens many years . everyone working government felt kinda bullshit , nobody could really anything . meanwhile , chief justice john roberts opined carrying two phones could reasonable grounds suspect someone drug dealer . clinton decided something . namely , told top aides email personal address could keep using whichever devices wanted . violated internal state department policy directive , known foreign affairs manual , stated okay use personal digital devices work occasionally , normal day day operations conducted standard state department equipment . clinton chose ignore guideline boss nobody could stop . career foreign service officers state personnel every right peeved clinton opted annoying policy rather fixing underlying issue , hardly matter overwhelming public concern . , indeed , turns colin powell also used private email address routine work

exact conclusion clinton use personal email address . hillary used private email server hillary tried eminently sensible following precedent defense , politifact dinged answer mostly false grounds powell use personal email account , use private email server . distinction attracted lot attention . proven politically damaging lots people maintain two email addresses sometimes work stuff personal email , americans use private email server opposed relying commercial email service . legally speaking , completely irrelevant . state department inspector general concluded report clinton conduct , guideline clinton violated principle normal day day operations conducted authorized automated information system . using private server violates rule , would using gmail address simply checking state.gov email address personal laptop rather department issue one . use private server legally irrelevant , certainly unusual . leaves people wondering clinton go way set private server ? clinton , may heard , married former president bill clinton , stepped office january . clinton white house throughout rest us bombarded aol signup cd roms , personal email left . gmail exist back , new job ,

journalists frustrated public officials constant foia dodging obviously dissimulation clinton really trying evade freedom information act . many people , example , point fact clinton would routinely travel multiple digital devices debunking supposed convenience argument . silly . known travel iphone , ipad , kindle , laptop . mean needing carry two separate iphones one check work email one check

generally speaking , life assume would moderately difficult hire well known law firm destroy evidence without someone deciding right thing squeal . besides , would almost comically easy catch clinton act systematically destroying relevant emails . vast majority work related email correspondence incumbent secretary state , , going correspondence government employees . maybe shoots note pentagon

basic setup email account way wrong investigation ended focusing question mishandling classified information . key point using state.gov email account would changed anything . us government officials conversations classified matters , supposed use email . supposed use special secure channels . nonetheless , mistakes happen part classification standards vague ever changing . technically speaking , forwarding washington post article detailing things revealed edward snowden could constitute improper discussion classified matters . fbi director james comey concluded , reasonable prosecutor would

statute sets lower gross negligence standard . however , jack goldsmith , one top lawyers george w. bush administration explains , prosecution would entirely novel , would turn part tricky questions

wrote comey characterization clearly correct last several months , people asking thought chances indictment . said time chance without evidence bad faith action kind . people simply get indicted

dynamics . first hetherington weiler insight partisan polarization . , republican party reinvented party law , order , traditional values position naturally appealed order tradition focused authoritarians . decades followed , authoritarians increasingly gravitated toward gop , concentration gave influence time . second stenner theory activation . influential book called authoritarian dynamic , stenner argued many authoritarians might latent might necessarily support authoritarian leaders policies authoritarianism activated . social threat theory helps explain authoritarians seem prone reject one specific kind outsider social change , muslims sex couples hispanic migrants , rather reject activation could come feeling threatened social changes evolving social norms increasing diversity , change believe profoundly alter social order want protect . response , previously moderate individuals would come support leaders policies might call trump esque . researchers , like hetherington , take slightly different view . believe authoritarians activated always held authoritarian preferences come express preferences feel threatened social change kind threat outsiders . schools thought agree basic causality authoritarianism . people support extreme policies strongman leaders affirmative desire authoritarianism , rather response experiencing certain kinds threats . third insight came hetherington american university professor elizabeth suhay , found non authoritarians feel sufficiently scared , also start behave , politically , like authoritarians . hetherington suhay found distinction physical threats terrorism , could lead non authoritarians behave like authoritarians , abstract social threats , eroding social norms demographic changes , effect . distinction would turn important , also meant times many americans perceived imminent physical threats , population authoritarians could seem swell rapidly . together , three insights added one terrifying theory social change physical threats coincided time , could awaken potentially enormous population american authoritarians , would demand strongman leader extreme policies necessary , view , meet rising threats . theory would seem predict rise american political constituency looks awful lot like support base emerged , seemingly nowhere , propel donald trump sideshow loser gop primary

powerful drive trump ascent , else might shaping american politics ? effect could even race ended ? iv . authoritarianism explain ? trump greets supporters alabama mark wallheiser getty images early february , shortly trump finished second iowa caucus ended doubts support , began talking feldman , hetherington , macwilliams try answer questions . macwilliams already demonstrated link authoritarianism support trump . wanted know else authoritarianism playing american life , policy positions party politics social issues , might mean america future . time call kyle dropp . dropp political scientist pollster one colleagues described doogie howser polling . indeed appear jarringly young dartmouth professor . also co founder media polling company , morning consult , worked vox several projects . approached morning consult , dropp colleagues excited . dropp familiar hetherington work authoritarianism measure , said , instantly intrigued could test relevance election . hetherington political scientists , turn , eager fully explore theories suddenly become much relevant . non authoritarians sufficiently frightened threats like terrorism could essentially scared acting like authoritarians put together five sets questions . first set , course , test authoritarianism feldman developed . would allow us measure authoritarianism coincided sets questions . second set asked standard election season questions preferred candidates party affiliation . third set tested voters fears series physical threats , ranging isis russia viruses car accidents . fourth set tested policy preferences , attempt see authoritarianism might lead voters support particular policies . research right , expect people scored highly authoritarianism express outsize fear outsider threats isis foreign governments versus threats . also expected non authoritarians expressed high levels fear would likely support trump . would speak physical fears triggering kind authoritarian upsurge , would turn lead trump support . wanted look role authoritarians playing election final set questions intended test fear social change . asked people rate series social changes actual hypothetical scale good bad country . included sex marriage , path citizenship undocumented immigrants living united states , american muslims building mosques us cities . theory social change

basic hypotheses authoritarianism , theory , supposed work . wanted look role authoritarians playing election driving certain policy positions , example ? wanted better understand larger forces suddenly made authoritarians numerous extreme migration , terrorism , perhaps decline working class whites ? maybe , wanted develop theories rise american authoritarianism meant future polarization parties well republican party become extreme internally divided . days later , shortly trump new hampshire primary , poll went field . less two weeks , results . v. gop became party authoritarians donald trump new jersey governor chris christie sign autographs trump campaign event texas tom pennington getty images donald trump new jersey gov . chris christie sign autographs trump campaign event texas . first thing jumped data authoritarians many . results found percent white respondents nationwide scored high high authoritarians , percent high . actually unusual , lines previous national surveys found authoritarian disposition far rare . key thing understand authoritarianism often latent people percent vote otherwise act authoritarians triggered perceived threat , physical social . latency part , past decades , authoritarians quietly become powerful political constituency without anyone realizing . today , according survey , authoritarians skew heavily republican . percent people scored highest authoritarianism questions gop voters . percent surveyed republicans scored high high authoritarians . end scale , pattern reversed . people whose scores non authoritarian meaning always chose non authoritarian parenting answer almost percent democrats . always case . according hetherington weiler research , story republicans mars democrats venus . story polarization increased time . trace trend , republican party shifted electoral strategies try win disaffected southern democrats , part speaking fears changing social norms example , racial hierarchies upset civil rights . gop also embraced law order platform heavily racial appeal white voters concerned race riots . positioned gop party traditional values social structures role maintained ever since . promise stave social change , necessary , impose order happened speak powerfully voters authoritarian inclinations . democrats , contrast , positioned party civil rights , equality , social progress words , party social change , position fails attract actively repels change averse authoritarians . next several decades , hetherington explained , led authoritarians naturally sort republican party . matters , authoritarians sort gop , influence policies candidates . nothing poll found half republican respondents score authoritarian . perhaps importantly , party less less ability ignore authoritarians voting preferences even preferences clash mainstream party establishment . vi . trump , authoritarians , fear based data , morning consult data scientist adam petrihos said among republicans , high high authoritarianism predictive support trump . trump percent support among republicans , according survey , full percent support among high authoritarians . authoritarianism best single predictor support trump , although high school education also came close . hetherington noted reviewing results , relationship authoritarianism trump support remained robust , even controlling education level gender . trump support much lower among republicans scored low authoritarianism percent . still awfully high . could explain trump support among non authoritarians ? suspected answer might lie least partly hetherington suhay research fear affects non authoritarian voters , called discuss data . hetherington crunched numbers physical threats noticed two things . first authoritarians tend fear specific kinds physical threats . authoritarians , found survey , tend fear threats come abroad , isis russia iran . threats , researchers point , people put face scary terrorist iranian ayatollah . non authoritarians much less afraid threats . instance , percent high scoring authoritarians believed terrorist organizations like isis posed high risk , percent low scoring authoritarians . domestic threats like car accidents , contrast , much less frightening authoritarians . hetherington also noticed something else subgroup non authoritarians afraid threats like iran isis . fear threats expressed , likely support trump . seemed confirm suhay theory non authoritarians sufficiently frightened physical threats terrorism could essentially scared acting like authoritarians . important , years , republican politicians republican leaning media fox news telling viewers nonstop world terrifying place president obama enough keep americans safe . variety political media incentives happens . point , result , republican voters continually exposed messages warning physical dangers . perception physical threat risen , fear appears led number non authoritarians vote like authoritarians support trump . irony primary republican establishment tried stop trump , among things , co opting message . establishment candidates marco rubio try match trump rhetoric isis american muslims , may end deepening fear lead voters back trump . vii . america changing social landscape activating authoritarianism ? research authoritarianism suggests physical threats driving . another kind threat larger , slower , less obvious , potentially even powerful pushing authoritarians extremes threat social change . could come form evolving social norms , erosion traditional gender roles evolving standards discuss sexual orientation . could come form rising diversity , whether means demographic changes immigration merely changes colors faces tv . could changes , political economic , disrupt social hierarchies . changes common , authoritarians , threaten take away status quo know familiar , orderly , secure replace something feels scary different destabilizing , also sometimes upends place society . according literature , authoritarians seek , response , strong leader promises suppress scary changes , necessary force , preserve status quo . , survey , wanted study degree authoritarians versus non authoritarians expressed fear social change whether , expected , led desire heavy handed responses . results seemed confirm authoritarians significantly likely rate almost actual hypothetical social issues asked bad bad country . instance , results suggested astonishing percent authoritarians believe sex marriage harmful country . twenty eight percent rated sex marriage bad america , another percent said bad . percent high scoring authoritarians said sex marriage good good country . tellingly , non authoritarians responses skewed opposite direction . non authoritarians tended rate sex marriage good good country . fact authoritarians non authoritarians split something seemingly personal nonthreatening sex marriage crucial understanding authoritarianism triggered even social change minor expanding marriage rights . also asked respondents rate whether muslims building mosques american cities good thing . intended test respondents comfort level sharing communities muslims issue particularly contentious primary election . whopping . percent high scoring authoritarians said either bad bad country muslims built mosques . percent group said mosques would good good . literature authoritarianism suggests simple islamophobia , rather reflects broader phenomenon wherein authoritarians feel threatened people identify outsiders possibility changes status quo makeup communities . would help explain authoritarians seem prone reject one specific kind outsider social change , muslims sex couples hispanic migrants , rather reject . seemingly disparate groups common perceived threat pose status quo order , authoritarians experience threat . america point status quo social order changing rapidly several social changes converging . converging especially working class white people . conventional wisdom ascribe rise first tea party right trump notion working class white americans angry . indeed , data helps explain also certain demographic economic pressures , according research , highly likely trigger authoritarianism thus suggests something little complex going simple anger helps explain gravitation toward extreme political responses . working class communities come tremendous economic strain since recession . white people also facing loss privileged position previously able take granted . whites projected become minority group next decades , owing migration factors . president black man , nonwhite faces growing common popular culture . nonwhite groups raising increasingly prominent political demands , often demands coincide issues policing also speak authoritarian concerns . factors might considered less legitimately threatening others loss working class jobs country real important issue , matter one feels fading white privilege point . point , rather , increasingly important political phenomenon identify right wing populism , white working class populism , seems line , almost astonishing precision , research authoritarianism caused expressed . dismiss white working class concerns invalid might expressed authoritarians authoritarian politics , rather better understand happening profound extreme effect american politics . misunderstood hard line social conservatism along ? social threat questions followed similar pattern . surface , might seem suggest authoritarianism proxy especially hard line manifestations social conservatism . examined carefully , suggests something interesting nature social conservatism . liberals , may easy conclude opposition things like sex marriage , immigration , diversity rooted bigotry groups manifestation specific homophobia , xenophobia , islamophobia . results vox morning consult poll , along prior research authoritarianism , suggests might something else going . particular reason , , parenting goals coincide animus specific groups . asking questions whether important children respect people different races , whether respect authority rules generally . coincide heavily ? might look surface like bigotry really much closer stenner theory activation likely , hetherington suggested , authoritarians much susceptible messages tell fear specific whether preexisting animus group . fears would therefore change time events made different groups seem less threatening . depends , said , whether particular group people made outgroup whether identified dangerous . since september , media outlets politicians painted muslims dangerous america . authoritarians , nature , susceptible messages , thus likely come oppose presence mosques communities . told fear particular outgroup , hetherington said , average people score low authoritarianism like , worried , people score high authoritarianism like , oh , god ! worried , world dangerous place . words , might look surface like bigotry really much closer stenner theory activation authoritarians unusually susceptible messages ways outsiders social changes threaten america , lash groups identified objects concern given moment . say attitude way better simple racism xenophobia still dangerous damaging , especially empowers frightening demagogues like donald trump . perhaps point , helps explain trump supporters come quickly embrace extreme policies targeting outgroups mass deportation millions people , ban foreign muslims visiting us . think
