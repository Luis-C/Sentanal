        "text": "A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama. He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public. I ll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people s business. He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency. He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts, because he just doesn t care anymore. Recent months aside, everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors. Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution. It is in his best interest to do so. His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of confidential, secret and top secret by commenting that there s classified and then there s classified were not successful. He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies. Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found, it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so. A reporter with first hand knowledge sums up Obama s transparent government, Obama and his team criminalized reporting, becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon. A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government. We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency, public participation, and collaboration. Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government. Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated. He knew, as did his advisors and supporters, that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States. David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obama s campaigns. He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until . He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it. After leaving the Obama administration, Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface. Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth. Obama lied about his support FOR same sex marriage before announcing his support for it in . Yet if Obama s views were evolving publicly, they were fully evolved behind closed doors, Axelrod writes. The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed. Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the campaign. No one got under Barack s skin more than Maureen He was patronizing and disrespectful. This is a direct contradiction to the calm, composed, Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray. He even lashed out at Axelrod. Obama can have a short fuse, though he hides it from the public The president called Axelrod a mother r and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the president s debating techniques as Obama prepared for his debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney says Axelrod. While those incidents speak to Obama s two faced behavior, some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies Lie Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House. Truth In September , an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Iran s nuclear installations. Lie In May , Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was basically complete. Truth The Department of Homeland Security admits just . miles or of the border is fenced. Lie Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare. Truth A March edict from the Department of Health and Human Services HHS unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion. Ben Rhodes was Obama s partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration the Iran nuclear treaty. Rhodes, Obama s Deputy National Security Adviser, openly admitted his contempt for journalists, All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus. Now they don t. They call us to explain to them what s happening in Moscow and Cairo. Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington. The average reporter we talk to is years old, and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns. That s a sea change. They literally know nothing. He later admitted more to David Samuels, a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story In the spring of last year, legions of arms control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often clueless reporters. We created an echo chamber. They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say. Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt. Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen. In , Risen published State of War The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration. Unsurprisingly, President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers. Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources, something he vehemently refused to do. He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories Well, they have gone after investigative reporting. They try to take, essentially, stories that they don t like, and try to find some classified information that might be part of that, and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information. As you know, you could do that with virtually any story in Washington. Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration. In , Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year. He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in speech he told reporters Here, in the United States of America, police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground. In , despite Risen keeping his sources confidential, the federal government indicted Jeffrey A. Sterling, a former CIA operative, with leaking the classified information to Risen. He continued his defiance, facing jail time, when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling. Finally in January of , after years of uncertainty, the government decided not to call Risen in the trial. His fight for the truth had finally won. Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold. It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obama s years in the White House. The truth would be a refreshing change. A supporter of Risen, Jerry Kammer, a former Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies, has this to say about President Obama He promised to be a different kind of president. But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the government s misdeeds. His administration has been untransparent at so many levels. ",

Obama s massive ego and thin skin now has him publicly degrading Trump s landslide Electoral College victory and diligently working behind the scenes to thwart the will of the people. Barack Obama sat in the Oval Office with Donald Trump about one month ago and vowed to do his best to foster a peaceful transition of power and to carry out the desire of the American people. Those lofty sentiments turned snarky quickly when it came time for Obama to start packing up his belongings and vacate the people s house. Follow Donald J. Trump ? realDonaldTrump Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks.Thought it was going to be a smooth transition NOT! AM Dec , , Retweets , , likes Over the course of the past month, Obama added a record number of new regulations across a myriad of federal agencies that try to control our lives and livelihoods. In the past few days, he surpassed his own record and likely isn t done trying to curtail President Elect Trump s authority after he is sworn in as the th president of the United States. Obama instructed his ambassador to the United Nations to abstain from a vote which drastically impacted one of our most staunch allies, Israel. A veto by the United States, which has been done in the past, would have prevented the U.N. Security Council from attempting to create a two state solution between Israel and the Palestinians by demanding that settlement building in disputed areas cease immediately. Very quietly, Obama also welcomed more than , new Muslim refugees onto American soil. These people, largely men, already had their asylum requests denied by the Australian government. They were being held in a detention facility when Obama decided the American taxpayers should begin paying for their resettlement regardless of the risks to national security. President Obama had heralded George W. Bush s commitment to a respectful transition and promised his distraught staff would adhere to the same level of professionalism and decorum. Instead, he led the charge to behave like a petulant spoiled child himself. First, Michelle Obama sat down for a chat with Oprah Winfrey and claimed America is now without hope. Tens of millions of Americans are feeling hopeful for the first time in eight years, but those of us who live in flyover country or are part of blue collar communities or the middle class really don t matter to liberals. Lashing out at Donald Trump because We the People chose him over a corrupt, lying career politician simply showcases how shallow and self involved Barack Obama and his wife truly are. There is nothing Democrats in Congress can do to stop Trump s agenda from passing thanks to Harry Reid s short sighted pushing for the nuclear option. Michael Moore and his horde of liberal followers will not be able to stop Trump from being sworn in on January nor will they succeed in pushing his oath taking ceremony inside. The efforts of Disrupt protesters will fail just as surely as Jill Stein s recount endeavors. If Barack Obama wanted his legacy to involve appearing small, glib, and completely delusional, he has succeeded. He is now nothing more than a frustrating nuisance for President Elect Donald Trump and the patriotic Americans who cast ballots in his favor. Soon Obama will finally be gone, and Trump can repeal his foolish liberal regulations and executive orders and put the nation back on the track to greatness and prosperity for ALL!",

        "text": "Turkey s President Recep Erdogan has come out swinging today. With the U.S. led coalition Britain and France included recently suffering an embarrassing defeat in Aleppo, Syria when Iranian and Russian forces helped to liberate the city from ISIL, this latest incident could be seen as Turkey throwing salt on the U.S. wound. Erdogan s bombshell statements highlighted what most of the world is now coming to accept as reality They the U.S. give support to terrorist groups including Daesh IS ISIL . We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos. While no videos or pictures have been made public yet, the world can only hope that Erdogan and company can make good on his words by publicly disclosing their alleged evidence. Adding to the disclosure was Iran s Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan The Western coalition is of a formal nature, they have no real intention to fight neither in Syria nor in Iraq. We don t see any readiness on their part to play a truly useful and meaningful role in fighting IS, because it s them who have raised terrorists and they are interested in keeping them there. Maybe the coalition forces would like to see terrorists weakened, but certainly not destroyed, because those terrorists are their tool for destabilizing this region and some other parts of the world. Of course, this statement is no longer just a theory or speculation, as U.S. House Representative from Hawaii, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that would stop the U.S. government from funding and supporting ISIL, both directly and indirectly. Tulsi stated a few things sure to get the attention of many If you or I gave money, weapons or support to al Qaeda or ISIS, we would be thrown in jail. Why does our gov get a free pass on this? The CIA has also been funneling weapons and money through Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and others who provide direct and indirect support to groups like ISIS and al Qaeda. This madness must end. We must stop arming terrorists. The Government must end this hypocrisy and abide by the same laws that apply to its citizens. What is most interesting about Erdogan s comments today then is the fact that he is calling out the U.S. government for funding and arming ISIL and other terrorists groups, when he has also been called out for doing the same. Remember from the paragraph above that Tulsi Gabbard said Turkey is one of the countries arming and funding ISIL. We must also remember when Vladimir Putin said the same thing in November of . So, perhaps Turkey or certain aspects within the military and intelligence community within Turkey have stopped coordinating with the CIA and other intelligence groups in helping to aid ISIL. Putin and Erdogan have made it no secret as to their willingness to collaborate more over the past several months. One of the biggest signals of this growing collaboration between Russia and Turkey was the signing of the Turkish Stream pipeline in late October. Additionally, Moscow announced today that they will be intensifying cooperation between Turkey, Iran and themselves within Syria. Maybe, just maybe, Turkey has broken ties with the Western banking political cabal. Time will tell. It would make sense though in many ways if Turkey has broken off all or most ties with the Western cabal, as the world sees the writing on the wall for ISIL Time is short. Not only was ISIL defeated in Aleppo the biggest battle to date , but they are being defeated in Mosul, Iraq. Today, Iraq s Prime Minister Haider al Abadi told the world that ISIL would be defeated in Iraq within three months. Perhaps Turkey has made a full pivot East and is now working to defeat the terrorist group they were once arming and funding. Stranger things have happened. We watch in great anticipation as to what will happen next. ",

        "text": "On Tuesday, the Times of Israel reported that an Egyptian newspaper published what it called transcripts of meetings between top US officials including Secretary of State John Kerry and Palestinian officials that could, if true, prove Israel s accusations that the Obama regime was behind the anti Israel UN resolution approved by the Security Council. According to the Times of Israel At the same time, a report in an Israeli daily Tuesday night pointed to Britain helping draft the resolution and high drama in the hours leading up to the vote, as Jerusalem tried to convince New Zealand to bury the Security Council measure. In a meeting in early December with top Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, US Secretary of State John Kerry told the Palestinians that the US was prepared to cooperate with the Palestinians at the Security council, Israel s Channel TV said, quoting the Egyptian Al Youm Al Sabea newspaper. Also present at the meeting were US National Security Adviser Susan Rice, and Majed Faraj, director of the Palestinian Authority s General Intelligence Service. Kerry is quoted as saying that he could present his ideas for a final status solution if the Palestinians pledge they will support the proposed framework. The US officials advised the Palestinians to travel to Riyadh to present the plan to Saudi leaders. According to the Times, the Egyptian report fits Israeli claims that it has ironclad proof the Obama regime helped craft the anti settlement resolution. We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage, said David Keyes, spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Additionally, the Guardian said Israel may provide this information to the incoming Trump administration Doubling down on the claim a few hours later the controversial Israeli ambassador to Washington, Ron Dermer, went even further suggesting it had gathered evidence that it would present to the incoming Trump administration. We will present this evidence to the new administration through the appropriate channels. If they want to share it with the American people, they are welcome to do it, Dermer told CNN. According to Dermer, not only did the US not stand by Israel s side during the vote, it was behind this ganging up on Israel at the UN . Jeff Dunetz noted Israel fears that Kerry lays out his comprehensive vision for two state solution and then turns it into another Security Council resolution imposing additional anti Israel settlement terms on Israel, or at upcoming peace conference in Paris on Jan. that Israel is not attending, all before the Israel hating Obama leaves the White House three weeks from this coming Friday. Another possibility is the US recognizing a Palestinian State, any of the above eliminates the possibility of a negotiated solution. The Egyptian report did not detail whose transcripts of the meeting it had obtained or how it had obtained them. At the end of the meeting, the report said, Rice and Kerry requested that the content of the discussion remain secret because of the sensitivity of the matter during the transition period in the U.S. The same way Kerry kept negotiations for the Iran deal secret from Israel until it was too late. The Obama regime, however, has denied allegations that it was behind the resolution. We did not draft this resolution we did not introduce this resolution. We made this decision when it came up for a vote, Obama deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said Friday.",

The map below shows how Obama lost working class white voters in every state since taking office except for Vermont and Massachusetts. New York Times Democrats may have lost the white working class vote for generations. It s Obama s fault. And just this week Barack Obama was out again railing against white working class Americans for his party s woes. iPatriot reported Obama also blamed Rush Limbaugh, Fox News, and the NRA for distracting the country from his message of hope and change , particularly during the holiday season. If we re not actually out there changing the narrative like we are during campaigns, then folks in a lot of these communities, what they re hearing is Obama wants to take away my guns, he said. Obama is disrespecting my culture and is primarily concerned with coastal elites and minorities. Ah yes, the problem was you couldn t mindlessly brainwash the country Barack, not that your message was fundamentally anti American. Obama defended the robbers and hosted Black Lives Matter in the White House. The Black Lives matter led to several police deaths, lootings and burned businesses.

        "text": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is once again making accusations that the United States is directly supporting ISIS. He s been mixed up in rumors of his supposed profiteering from the illicit ISIS oil trade in the past, so his accusations carry with them a need for healthy skepticism. Still, he is adamant in his allegations and says he s got irrefutable evidence. His claims go beyond the single step of removal from direct involvement, our maintaining the implausible plausible deniability of aiding the so called freedom fighters or rebels, the insulation the US has relied upon in arming, training and financing Obama s terrorist allies in the past. It s more than an acknowledgment of the rebranding of ISIS terrorists, our supposed enemy, as anonymous factions under the White House subversive. It s beyond the contention of the Russians or the photographic evidence that John McCain was foolish enough to provide, what is basically little more than a choice in headscarf colors, the difference between their equivalent of the crips and the bloods, as being the legitimizing factor for aiding our terrorist enemies as the non existent moderate freedom fighters. Erdogan said in his Tuesday comments that he has confirmed evidence that US led forces have supported ISIS. Erdogan stated in no uncertain terms that it s very clear the US is supporting ISIS. He said, They were accusing us of supporting Daesh ISIS . Now they give support to terrorist groups including Daesh, YPG, PYD. It s very clear. We have confirmed evidence, with pictures, photos and videos. YPG and PYD are Kurdish groups that Erdogan regards as terrorists operating against Turkey. Flanked by the visiting Guinean President Alpha Conde, Erdogan said, The coalition forces are unfortunately not keeping their promises. Whether they do or they don t, we will continue along this path in a determined way. There is no going back on the path we have set out on. Erdogan complained They are supporting all the terror groups the YPG, PYD but also including Daesh ISIS It s quite clear, perfectly obvious, he said, adding that Turkey could provide proof in pictures and video. During a November visit to Pakistan Erdogan made similar claims, alleging the West stands by Daesh ISIS right now and its weapons were Western made. At the time he declined to provide his evidence for inspection. He needs to be more forthcoming this time around. If he s got the evidence, show it. Certainly none of us would be surprised to learn that Obama is behind ISIS, it s already well known. We would like to put our hands on his proof, though, in order to properly charge Obama and convict him.",

Jackie Evancho, a teenage opera singer who got her start on America s Got Talent, has agreed to sing the National Anthem for the inauguration. Many liberals have attacked her and her family, but proud Americans have supported her. Her music sales have quadrupled thanks to the American people! via Breitbart Evancho s Dream With Me album and her O Holy Night are both sitting at No. on the Billboard charts because of the American people and the pride they have in their country and this talented girl! For her part, Jackie Evancho has expressed her excitement to sing at this event, which is a breath of fresh air compared to the other singers who have flat out refused to be a part of it, even though they were not even asked in the first place. I have recently been asked by the President elect to perform the National Anthem for the swearing in ceremony at the inauguration, Evancho stated. I m so excited. It s going to be awesome. At least someone has some American pride. But liberals, of course, aren t about to hold back their disdain, even against a teenage girl. This is particularly ironic because of the details of Evancho s family. My family is kind of a big target. I have a transgender sister and so a lot of hate goes towards us, Evancho claimed. But I also get a lot of love. So, we pay most attention to that. Sometimes we get really annoyed with the hate, everyone does, we have to admit it but we just ignore it. So, Liberals are adding further hate directed at an innocent family who are trying to support their transgender member. I thought liberals were supportive of transgender people? Apparently they only care about the hate directed at them if the transgender person agrees with their political views. At , Jackie Evancho s list of accomplishments already includes six studio albums. Her O Holy Night EP made her the youngest solo artist to reach platinum on the U.S. Billboard and also ranked her as the No. Classical Albums Artist of . As one of the few people who are scheduled to perform for Donald Trump s inauguration, the young singer clearly has a ton of talent. The Radio City Rockettes and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir also planned to perform for the incoming President.

        "text": "Once, Harry Reid pushed through the nuclear option to thwart the Republicans from representing their constituents. That very move is now coming back to haunt his Liberals peers just as Reid makes his long overdue exit from Congress. He was warned that he and his fellow Democrats would one day regret this, but the arrogant Nevada Senators ignored the sound words of advice.That day has now arrived. The nuclear option will allow the Republican controlled Senate to turn bills into law by a simple majority of votes and not the super majority which requires votes of approval, as Biz Pac Review notes. Harry Reid s nuclear option requiring only votes to pass measures in the Senate coincided with exactly the number of seats Liberals held at the time. Now, the Republicans control both the House and Senate which will allow them to easily pass all of the items President Elect Donald Trump s agenda, if the career GOP politicians have the nerve, of course. Should any GOP Senators jump ship and a rare tie occur in the Senate, Trump s agenda will still survive a nuclear option vote. Vice President Elect Mike Pence holds the tie breaking vote! At least in public, Liberals are not willing to admit they are kicking themselves over following Harry Reid s urgings on the nuclear option vote. At the time, Reid claimed the extreme rule change was necessary because the GOP was engaged in unprecedented obstruction. Apparently saying NO! to economically unfeasible Obama dictates is obstruction. The Republicans were following the Constitution and doing the job they were elected by We the People to do which they can now do even more easily thanks to Harry Reid. If Republicans want to go on record supporting radicals, that s their decision and they will have to live with it, Kristen Orthman, a spokeswoman for Sen. Reid, said. If its radical to put Americans first, than so be it. Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley claims he has absolutely no regret, over Reid s nuclear option. Charles Schumer, the incoming Senate Minority Leader, doesn t appear to have been all that eager to accept the nuclear option. Schumer reportedly wanted to keep the super majority vote threshold for both cabinet and Supreme Court appointments. Either his peers in the Senate did not share his concerns about the future when Republicans would be back in power, and felt Liberals would always be able to maintain a majority in the Senate, or were just too afraid of Harry Reid to vote against his plan. One Liberal Senator, Richard Shelby from Alabama, tried to warn his fellow Democrats they were engaging in short term thinking when voting in favor of the nuclear option. They ignored his wise words as well, and totally ignored the big picture when placing their votes. Democrats won t be in power in perpetuity. This is a mistake a big one for the long run. Maybe not for the short run. Short term gains, but I think it changes the Senate tremendously in a bad way, Senator Shelby said before the vote was taken in . Following both the text and the spirit of the Constitution while putting America and Americans first, would only be considered a radical concept by Liberals who have sipped far too much of the Kool Aid handed out by the members of the politically correct far left contingent in Washington. Democrats will now be at the mercy of Donald Trump and the elected public servants across the aisle for at least the next four years and they have only themselves to blame!",

Entire precincts surrounding Detroit may be un recountable, due to suspected voter fraud! Officials have found that, in hundreds of cases, the poll book numbers do not match the electronic voting machine printouts, as per The Detroit News. Michigan state law holds that if a precinct is unable to be recounted, then the original count must stand. Some of the problems may be due to biased elections staff. The machines used in Michigan, according to Detroit Elections Director Daniel Baxter, are quite old. In fact, of the machines optical scanners broke on election day. When there is such a problem with the machines, a ballot may get jammed in the scanner. The election staff then has to pull the ballot out and try again. This could result in a ballot being counted twice, or even six times, as the staff tries to get the ballot into the machine again and again. The staff can manually erase the duplicate votes, but Baxter says that in many cases, they failed to do so. What, they forgot? Or perhaps they wanted to count the vote multiple times? Of course, many of these precincts are strongly Democrat, at least according to historic voting trends. This includes Wayne County where Clinton received roughly two thirds of the vote. If such widespread voter fraud has occurred, perhaps Michigan is a lot less blue than we thought. There are other explanations for the vote discrepancies as well. As WND is reporting, Republican candidate Ken Crider has been keeping a close eye on his District s elections process. Crider said, in a Facebook post, Penny s precinct, Detroit Precinct , had an unbroken seal and everything looked proper. The tag on the box said and the book said and the ticket said , so there should be paper ballots on the box, right? Well, when they pulled out the ballots, the stack seemed short, and when they finished separating the two page ballot to count the presidential page only, guess how many ballots were in the box? no, nope, nada, how about wrong again. There were only exactly paper ballots in a locked sealed box that again was supposed to have . HMMMM. Crider is right to point out this mysterious circumstance. If the seal was unbroken and there were no holes in the ballot box, then why was there an incorrect amount of ballots in there? It would be understandable to be off by one vote, but to be off by hundreds is highly suspicious and points, once again, to the election staff. In my opinion, each of these staff members should be barred from working elections again. Whether through negligence or intention, something very bad has been going on here.

AP Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over , times. The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio and others about the size of Donald Trump s hands. Look at those hands, are they small hands? Trump told the audience at his rally in Detroit back in March. And he Rubio referred to my hands, if they re small something else must be small. I guarantee you there s no problem, I guarantee it. Donald Trump s penis size A screenshot of Donald Trump s tweet captured by ABC News just minutes before it was deleted. He s always calling me Little Marco. And I ll admit he s taller than me, Rubio told ABC News. He s like , which is why I don t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is , Rubio said in Virginia on Sunday. And you know what they say about men with small hands? You can t trust them. The New York billionaire has heard similar comments about his hands or, more precisely, his fingers, for years. As Vanity Fair s Graydon Carter recalled online last year Just to drive him a little bit crazy, I took to referring to him as a short fingered vulgarian in the pages of Spy magazine. That was more than a quarter of a century ago. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she isn t surprised by Trump s actions. Donald Trump is an ego maniac, racist, bigot, who brings out the worst in the worst people, Bradley said. We get donations from poor people, the middle class and the upper class all the time. Since Donald Trump is the least charitable billionaire in the entire world, we expect no donations from that dick pic tweeting pervert anytime soon. Fappy The Anti Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told reporters that he agrees with Trump s actions. If everyone says you have a small penis, you don t keep it in your pants, you don t hide it you prove them wrong! This is exactly what a real president should do! Praise Donald Trump! Praise Fappy! David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is accomplishing. You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well , but that s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us.

        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. AP U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz R Texas sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this The single most important issue facing the country today and that without swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self satisfaction . Self love is a silent killer in this country. This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children down a dark and destructive path. It starts innocently enough with a JC Penney catalogue tucked under your mattress, but it quickly spirals out of control, and before you know it, your mother has to call the coroner because you ve died from auto erotic asphyxiation. I m not saying that we should lock up these one armed bandits and throw away the key what we need is a compassionate approach that helps these deviants reform and become productive members of society. That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil s playground for good, Cruz said. I m asking Mr. Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem, and commit to finding real solutions. If he does that, I will do whatever it takes to help him secure the White House in November. Should Mr. Trump decline, I think it s safe to say that all options, including a third party run, are out on the table. Donald Trump told ABC News that he was open to the idea, though he refused to take a clear stand on the issue. Look, do I think Ted Cruz is right about this? Maybe he is, maybe he isn t. To be honest, I don t know a lot about this subject matter. I don t need to. I have a wife that takes care of this for me, and she s a beautiful wife, the best wife, the greatest wife. My people are going to take a hard look into this matter and find a great answer for it, the best answer there is. I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz, and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non reproductive purposes illegal. This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self stimulation. As solicitor general of Texas in he fought to uphold the state s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no Right to stimulate one s genitals. Cruz eventually lost this battle, but the story re surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention, prompting Cruz s former college roommate Craig Mazin to tweet that Cruz s stance against stimulating one s own genitals was A new belief of his , implying that much of Cruz s time in college was, in fact, spent stimulating his own genitals. Another one of Cruz s former college roommates, Matt Daemon, has recently come forward to corroborate Mazin s story. All Ted Cruz did was take care of little Ted Cruz back then, which is fine I guess, but he was always real creepy about doing it. Honestly, I lost track of the number of times I came home to find him laying on the couch naked, lotion and Kleenex next to him, watching re runs of Walker Texas Ranger. He wouldn t even try and cover up when I caught him, he would just stare at me in the eyes and continue until I left the room. It s absolutely hilarious about the tough stance on touching one s self that Ted has taken in this country. I truly believe he may have pulled on it one too many times and it broke or something and now feels that if he can t do it anymore, then no one can. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, told ABC News that she is sickened by the Republican party. It is absolutely disgusting that in this day in age, a creepy weirdo like Ted Cruz was almost elected as the GOP nomination for President, Bradley said. With all the real problems in this country like starvation, so many people out of work and families living on the street, Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime. Bradley continued, Also, I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless, it means so much. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps. Cruz, however, remains undeterred by his detractors. When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep, and they are weeping for this country hours a day, days a week. America needs strong moral leadership, and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task. The fate of our great nation is in his hands hopefully, they re big enough to handle it. Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter. A recent poll by the New York Times found that of likely Trump voters support a ban on self stimulation due to moral and religious concerns. Another would be okay with a ban, saying that they, like Trump, have far too many potential suitors, and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges. Only of Trump supporters are against a ban. RNC political strategist, year old Paul Horner, calls the move a no brainer and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz. Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue. If Donald does not side with the Senator, he risks alienating the party s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton. Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one, no matter how creepy, insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is. David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing. You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well , but that s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time!

        "text": "New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew away for life, NYPD sources told True Pundit. NYPD sources said Clinton s crew also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders. The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over , emails to and from Hillary Clinton, Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state. The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday. But new revelations on the contents of that laptop, according to law enforcement sources, implicate the Democratic presidential candidate, her subordinates, and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails, sources said. NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to Money laundering Child exploitation Sex crimes with minors children Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief, the department s highest rank under Commissioner, said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co conspirators, NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices. What s in the emails is staggering and as a father, it turned my stomach, the NYPD Chief said. There is not going to be any Houdini like escape from what we found. We have copies of everything. We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that. The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton. People are going to prison, he said. Meanwhile, FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents, who have taken over the non sexting portions the case from NYPD. The husband and wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals, sources said. If they don t cooperate they are going to see long sentences, a federal law enforcement source said. NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop. The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too, sources said. Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner s cell phones and travel records, law enforcement sources confirmed. NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin, however, the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records. Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas, U.S. Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge. The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton, President Bill Clinton, Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing on multiple occasions to his private island in the U.S Virgin Islands, sources said. Epstein s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries. Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein s guest on at least six occasions, probably more when all the evidence is combed, sources said. Bill Clinton, it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years, that he too traveled with Epstein over times to the island. Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified, Top Secret Breaches According to other uncovered emails, Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiner s unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D.C. Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner.com. Weiner, a former seven term Democratic Congressman from New York, primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City. At one point, FBI sources said, Abedin and Clinton s classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiner s email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop. However, Weiner and Abedin, who is Hillary Clinton s closest personal aide, weren t the only people with access to the Weiner s email account. Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedin s sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiner s email account, FBI sources confirmed. FEC records show Weiner paid more than , of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site. According to FBI sources, the D.C. based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner.com domain since , the same time Abedin was working at the State Department. This means technically Weiner and Abedin s emails, including top secret State Department emails, could have been accessed, printed, discussed, leaked, or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed, FBI sources said. According to FBI sources, the bureau s newly minted probe into Clinton s use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state, has also been broadened to include investigating new email related revelations, including Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner s email Abedin stored emails, containing government secrets, in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over , archived State Department emails. Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail.com address to send receive store classified and top secret documents A private consultant managed Weiner s site for the last six years, including three years when Clinton was secretary of state, and therefore, had full access to all emails as the domain s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts. Because Weiner s campaign website is managed by the third party consultant and political email guru, FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiner s server and emails and who were these people. Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers, or other actors. Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didn t know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept. of State system. Instead, she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo, Clintonemail.com and her email linked to Weiner. Abedin said, according to FBI documents, she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept. and print the documents, many of which were classified and top secret, from the largely unprotected webmail portals. Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept. so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her, Abedin said. Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept. fax machine installed in her Chappaqua, NY home without assistance. Perhaps more alarming, according to the FBI s Report detailing its interview with Abedin, none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner. There was never a follow up, according to the report. But now, all that has changed, with the FBI s decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptop s emails.",

Clinton, who has deep ties to Soros, also wore purple during her concession speech on Nov. . Soros, a socialist billionaire best known for breaking the British pound in , has funded government overthrows, known as color revolutions, in Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and other countries in the former Soviet bloc, the Middle East and North Africa. And now he s trying to do the same using far left radicals in the U.S., if Hillary s recent penchant for the color purple is any indication. But why purple? It s the color resulting from mixing red and blue and Clinton and others pushing the upcoming purple revolution will likely justify it as the unification of the divided red and blue states of America. Anytime globalist politicians embrace a color, be on guard for a revolution bearing that particular hue, reported D.C. journalist Wayne Madsen. On the day after the election that propelled Donald Trump into the White House, Hillary and Bill Clinton entered the ballroom of the Moonie Unification Church owned New Yorker hotel in midtown Manhattan adorned in the color purple. Mrs. Clinton wore a pant suit with purple lapels and a purple blouse, while Bill Clinton wore a purple tie. Already many of the nationwide protests since the election were coordinated by the Soros funded activist group MoveOn.org. When it comes to themed revolutions, the Sorosites have refined the art to a science, Madsen added. While Mrs. Clinton called for uniting the nation in her concession speech, Soros s minions took the streets in protests, some turning violent, across the United States. Clinton, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from Soros, showed her real intentions by signaling the start of Soros s Purple Revolution in the United States. ",

President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers this week when he signs an executive order directing the Supreme Court to indefinitely suspend the nd Amendment.

Citing poor performance on the part of a Republican controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels obligated to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis just like Roosevelt.

A groundbreaking study conducted by researchers at MIT suggests Americans living in the United States could find themselves outnumbered by illegal immigrants by a staggering ratio of at least two to one within the next ten years unless significant changes are made to U.S. immigration policy. If we continue traveling at our current trajectory, we as Americans will soon become a minority in our own country, warned Dr. Emilio Martinez. Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten year period. What we ve seen is an incremental increase of twenty three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border. The U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over million people by . However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesn t factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by will reach approximately million with just under forty nine per cent consisting of American citizens, Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a margin of error. In contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about . million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the country s ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. Mexicans as we ve seen over the last quarter century have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada, said Luis Garcia, a third year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades. Garcia s data shows that by , a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below . million.

Dubbed Steven the Great by Mr. Putin, the sixty four year old Under Siege star will take up residence at the Grand Livadia Palace in the coastal city of Yalta where he will hold power over nearly two million Crimeans.

People all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers, Obama told reporters.

The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump. Under the President s order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday s election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president s decision. Crooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn t allow that to happen. President Obama doesn t care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right. The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. We have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary. Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. Most people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than , votes, but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the electors who meet in their respective states on December th. What the people are actually voting for are their states electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them. Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President s Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. The electoral college is a f king joke we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in , but so did the three fifths compromise. Everyone should have an equal vote, and that s just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It s time to bring our system into the st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare. Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. We re going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this, Obama said. Why did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn t this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this? Obama said. If all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered. If you have any questions about the recount or the special December th election, you can call the Obama administration s special election hotline at .",

Far too long has the Chinese narrative over climate change kept our economy in a rut. It s time to open the pumps and as I like to say Drill, baby, drill! Sarah Palin, former Alaska governor whitehousepalin Scientists and academics alike have already voiced concerns that Sarah Palin s strong disbelief in climate change could have dramatic consequences for the planet.

The woman claimed in an interview in that God killed the dinosaurs and that he had sent the flood to purge the dinosaurs off of the earth, he warned, visibly concerned. With Sarah Palin as director of the Office of Science and Technology, we are definitely stepping into la la land he adds. A scientific community in disbelief Sarah Palin s strong stance against climate change in the past has earned her an army of detractors, especially within environmentalist circles. In a UN statement that acknowledged that of climate experts agree humans are causing global warming, Sarah Palin responded, the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd and called the IPCC report a load of rubbish and a fraud . With irresponsible leaders such as Trump and Palin in the White House, polar ice cap melting will increase dramatically and waters could rise an easy in the next ten years has even admitted James Hillocks, a top Greenpeace climate scientist.

Her name was Monica Petersen, and she turned up dead in Haiti on Sunday after posting I Found A Smoking Gun on social media. Her friends and family are calling foul as her family cannot get believable information from Haitian authorities, and Ms. Petersen just happened to publicly post some reports that implicate the Clintons involvement in alleged human trafficking via a mine run by Hillary Clinton s brother Tony Rodham. A compilation of the various threads from reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Imgur and more can be found on the Reddit The Donald page here. Go figure. Just like any number of people either close to the Clintons or investigating them who could possibly end up a material witness during a trial, Ms. Petersen ends up dead. This, for those following the fake news propaganda coming out of globalists, leftists, and the disgraced legacy media, is why there is a Clinton Body Count. Monica Petersen s name may well be added to it. According to several reports, Haiti has been a nexus for child trafficking for a number of years. In fact, found in the thousands of emails released by WikiLeaks from John Podesta s email account, information surfaced that Hillary Clinton assisted a Haitian woman, Laura Silsby, known to be involved in child trafficking in when she was caught trying to take children not orphans out of Haiti. The two women s history is known to reach back at least fifteen years. Also in the Podesta emails are several archaic conversations about pizza that have taken on the aura of internet lore what some call conspiracy theories known as pizzagate, and reportedly is the tip of the iceberg in an international child trafficking ring. The rabbit hole gets very deep when one considers how many times Bill Clinton is known to have traveled Jeffrey Epstein s private child molestation island. Did Monica Petersen get too close? A tenacious young woman investigating one of the most egregious crimes any human can commit, if she got too close to the criminal element and was known to them, it is a definite possibility. A good friend of hers named Bella claims she found out what happened and is refusing to elaborate on public next pagemessaging boards. Whatever the case is, the people around the Clintons and those investigating them sure do tend to end up dead.",

Mr. Erdogan claimed that Muslim explorers reached the Moon more than years before the beginning of the Appolo program, vowing to build a mosque in the crater where they landed. It is alleged that the first man to walk on the moon was Neil Armstrong in , Erdogan said. In fact, Muslim space explorers reached our satellite years before that, in . Everyone knows the story of the famous aviator, Lag ri Hasan elebi, the Ottoman Rocket Man , who made the first successful manned rocket flight in . What you might not know, is that he attempted to reach the moon, two years later, and could very well have succeeded! The story of Lagari Hasan elebi was purported by a famous th century Arab merchant and traveller, Mehmed Zilli, also known as Evliya elebi. In his famous travelog, he explains that Lagari Hasan elebi launched in a winged rocket using okka . kg or lbs of gunpowder. It took off from Sarayburnu, a site below the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul. As Evliya Celebi wrote, Lagari proclaimed before launch O my sultan! Be blessed, I am going to talk to Jesus! , before lighting the rocket s gunpowder. He then ascended more than meters in the air and landed in the sea, hundreds of meters from his takeoff point. Swimming ashore, he allegedly reported O my sultan! Jesus sends his regards to you! . This th century engraving depicts one of Lag ri Hasan elebi s famous rocket flights, but it s unclear if it represents his first flight or his attempt to reach the moon, in . President Erdogan s surprising claim generated some whispers and laughter from the audience, a reaction that clearly angered the Turkish politician. He slammed the skeptics for mocking his claims, adding that he would soon have the proofs to back his claims. Why do you not believe it? Because you ve never believed that a Muslim can do such a thing, just like you ve never believed that our ancestors could manage to launch ships in the Golden Horn after transporting them across land, Erdogan said, referring to Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II s conquest of Istanbul in . This claim is not new. A number of academics in Turkey and in the rest of the world have made this claim, and I believe they are right. NASA may have destroyed most of the physical evidence of the Ottoman s success during the Apollo mission, but we ll try to find any evidence that might have escaped the cover up. The Turkish President did not, however, give any precision about the proofs he was expecting to find nor how he was hoping to gather them. ottoman The description of the flying engine used by Lag ri Hasan elebi is pretty vague and doesn t really allow modern scientists to accurately recreate the design. This sketch shows the basic design as it is described, but is almost certainly incomplete or partially inaccurate. The story of Lag ri Hasan elebi is considered a legend by most historians, and most experts believe that it is impossible that the aviator could have survived a flight into outer space. His first flight was, indeed, addressed in an experiment by the television show MythBusters, on November , , in the episode Crash and Burn . The rocket constructed for the TV show did not adhere closely, however, to Evliya elebi s descriptions and the final design did not attempt to utilize materials of the period The team noted that Evliya elebi had not sufficiently specified the alleged design used by Lag ri Hasan, but concluded that it would have been extremely difficult for a th century figure, without access to modern steel alloys and welding techniques, to land safely or even achieve thrust at all. This conclusion was backed by the fact that, although the re imagined rocket rose, it exploded in midflight",

An independent study conducted by the bipartisan policy group Alliance for Community Organizations seeking Reform Now has determined that just over fifty nine percent of voters who support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffer from moderate to severe illiteracy. Posing as representatives from the Nationalist Reform Council a fictional conservative action group ACORN officials staged several mock elections last month at community centers throughout Cullman County, Alabama, under the pretense of helping residents register to vote in time for the general election. We were really pleased with the turnout, said Matthew Breyer, who heads ACORN s northern Alabama office. We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days. Once residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. We wanted to get an idea of the average voter s understanding of the election process, Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice. However, unbeknownst to participants, the ballots had been slightly altered. Under the category U.S. President U.S. Vice President, you had the option for Clinton Kaine centered inside a solid red rectangle, Breyer explained. Likewise, the option for Trump Pence was centered inside a solid blue rectangle. Following the simulation s conclusion, ACORN officials were amazed to discover that more than two thirds of registered Republicans in Cullman County who participated in the mock election had cast their votes in favor of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. She won by a massive landslide, recalled Breyer. The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party. This should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country, said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King. This may have been a simulation but we ve got multiple GOP leaders saying there s going to be a rigged election next month. There s a legitimate fear that you ll have altered ballots just like this popping up all over the country and as a result, we ll be forced to suffer another four years under Obama s failed policies. In recent days, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has increasingly warned supporters that the upcoming presidential election will be rigged against him. Of course there is a large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day, the former reality TV star tweeted on Monday.

Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety minute Skype video session last weekend with North Korea s Supreme Leader Kim Jong un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol as extraordinary, saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health. We had a wonderful conversation, the former reality TV star said of Kim. He s very different from the way he s portrayed by the media and, you know, that s something I can relate to. Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. We both love meatloaf, Trump exclaimed. He said he eats it all the time. I said You ought to come to New York, I ll give you the best meatloaf you ve ever had in your life. Aside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. If they had that nuclear threat, I m sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula, the president elect said. For his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North Korea s single party political system. I told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country. During his nearly two hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country. I think it would be very good thing to have, said Trump, adding, You d see a change in this country like you wouldn t believe. Vice president elect Mike Pence, who heads Trump s transition team, described the ninety minute Skype session as very casual, telling The New York Times that it s not unusual for world leaders to reach out following an election. This was the elected leader of the Democratic People s Republic of Korea a democracy very similar to ours offering his congratulations and good wishes, the vice president elect explained.

        "text": " NaturalNews If a thug points a gun to your head, hands you a piece of paper, and says, Sign this contract, is the contract legally binding? Of course it isn t. It was coerced under the threat of violence, and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding. Yet right now, electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint, threatened with being killed if they don t change their votes to oppose Donald Trump. The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo psyop means psychological operations which falsely claims the Russians hacked the election, despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative. The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited. It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders. The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D.C. and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians. Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails, phone calls and letters and even death threats in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday, reports the NY Post today. The NY Post also reports Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states, including Georgia, Idaho, Tennessee, Arizona, Utah and Michigan. For Michael Banerian, a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector, the harassment comes with a dark side. He said he s been getting death threats via email, snail mail, Twitter and Facebook. Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth, Banerian, , told The Post on Wednesday. Leftists are kidnapping electoral voters and holding them for ransom What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election. Yet the very existence of such persistent, coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes, knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed. Thus, electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding. They may be reclaimed by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states. In essence, the political left organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton has psychologically kidnapped the electoral voters, and they re demanding a kind of ransom or they will be killed. That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump. In other words, this is a political mugging where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying, Your vote or your life. And if they manage to switch electoral votes through such death threats, the left will declare a victory for America, proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being heroes for saving the country. Unbelievable, isn t it? This is right out of the Kim Jong Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship, which is probably why the radical left loves it so much. If you do what they want, you re heralded as a national hero. If you don t do what they want, you get a bullet in the head. This really is the way liberals exert power, by the way, which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption, they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks. The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out. Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracy they re pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation. Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists, if they don t get their way, they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them. Sound familiar? Look up the history of China s Cultural Revolution. That s the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba, North Korea or Communist China. And it s perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left If they don t get their way, they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them. I ve got news for those who espouse such threats of violence, coercion and lawlessness We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic. And after we stop you, we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason. From there, the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes. Once President Trump is sworn into office, I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters. Those individuals must be arrested, imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes, including sedition. Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing. It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic. Such threats cannot go unpunished. Hey, we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use! In observing all this, I ve come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war. But I also believe a civil war won t last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police, military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement. It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all That s where we can put all the left wing terrorists and traitors who tried but failed to overthrow the country. There, we ll pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama, a master of linguistic subterfuge. Over time, some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane, rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today. After all, we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible. Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they don t agree with, conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters, no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times. Remember The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives. That s why they are so traumatized by reality They ve been poisoned, programmed, hypnotized and traumatized by the left wing media for as long as they can remember! It s time to finally set all Americans free from the psychological prisons that have been built for them by the corrupt political left. That effort begins anew on January , , which is precisely why the radical left is planning to stage a mass uprising on that day. They last thing the left wants is Americans who aren t subjected to a daily dose of left wing propaganda. Stay tuned to NaturalNews.com and NewsTarget.com for more details as all this moves forward.

Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, revealing new details about why the bureau revisited the email case just days before the presidential election. The FBI s investigation found email chains containing classified information on a laptop that was never authorized for the storage or transmission of classified or national defense information, according to the application for the warrant, which was partially redacted. The October re opening of the Clinton investigation sprung from an unrelated case involving Weiner allegedly sexting with an underage girl. During the course of that inquiry, agents discovered the joint laptop and later found emails addressed to and sent from Clinton. It s the end of the line for the Clinton crime machine.",

        "text": "Trump might be able to reverse it, but it s tricky. He s only got a few weeks left to damage America s energy independence. Obama needs to work fast, and he is. Ever the creative one, Obama has found a way to twist the original intent of a law passed in to enact bans on offshore drilling in massive sections of the Atlantic and Arctic oceans. The law was never intended to facilitate any such action, as The Hill explains, but since when does Obama consider himself constrained by the law? Obama will use a section of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to implement the protections, Bloomberg and The New York Times reported, citing sources familiar with the plans. It s unclear, however, how large Obama s protected areas will be. The action would answer calls from environmentalists to implement so called a protections in the Atlantic and Arctic as a more lasting legacy against fossil fuels from Obama. Obama last month made final a plan for offshore drilling lease sales from to that excludes the Atlantic and Arctic. But that plan s time period is limited, and President elect Donald Trump can revise the plan to insert lease sales if he wishes. Previous presidents have used the law rarely. In each case, they focused on small areas of water and set time limits in an effort to protect particular species. It s unclear how easily Trump can undo the protections, since no previous president has tried to roll back a predecessor s actions under that law. Congress may also step in to undo Obama s actions. This is a classic act of recklessness on Obama s part applying a law beyond all recognition of its original intent, and telling American oil companies they can t explore gigantic portions of the world. Just because he s Barack Obama and he hates fossil fuels. He also leave a mess for Donald Trump to try to clean up, if he can. Can he? Maybe. The most effective way for Trump to reverse Obama s heading out the door finger in the eye to America s oil industry, if not necessarily the simplest, would be to ask Congress to make an amendment to the law, essentially nullifying Obama s actions. He could also amend Obama s drilling lease plan for the period of by adding more leases, conceivably in the areas of the Atlantic and Arctic where Obama is trying to ban them. What Trump might try to do instead is simply declare that Obama s action under the law is null and void at the executive level, and substitute his own. It s not clear how much force of law Obama s action has, although it s not purely an executive order because he did take the action under an existing statute albeit very far afield from the original intent of the statute. I suspect that if Trump simply tries to reverse Obama s actions unilaterally, there will be political resistance but no real constituency with an avenue to effectively prevent Trump s action. There is some luxury of time here, because at the moment most American oil companies who engage in offshore drilling do so almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico. Offshore drilling in the Pacific has also been made very difficult by political resistance, and that could also be a challenge for Trump s new EPA. In the meantime, Obama shows us once again that his priority above all else is the service of a left wing ideological agenda. If he wanted to enact this ban at any point during his presidency, he could have done so and dealt with the political blowback. Instead, he waited until the final weeks of his presidency so he could lay this trap for his successor, and for the nation, to deal with. As relieved as we are that we will never have to talk about President Hillary, the end of President Obama can t come soon enough either.",

I knew if ISIS were not stopped, they would spread their crimes everywhere. And just like a cancer that continues to metastasize and slowly eat away at a person s insides, her self fulfilling prophecy has come true in more ways than one. Obama is just like an inept doctor in that regard, and Murad called him out on it If a country as strong as your country cannot protect its citizens in Orlando, or in Belgium or in France, how come a small minority like us can protect ourselves while we are in the heart of the land where radicals are? Murad said bravely. Well, Ms. Murad, it might have something to do with the fact we are knee deep in the bull pen called political correctness. Obama s decision not to call radical Islamic terrorism by its name and his choice to redact the original transcript from the Pulse gunman bore witness to that fact back in June. And where was the outrage after the Pulse massacre when the FBI investigation into the gunman was dropped due to concerns of Islamophobia? Where is the outrage now that people in Berlin are dead and their families devastated? Where s the outrage that Russia has responded appropriately while we are still sitting on our butts? Don t we realize President Obama could have prevented all of this a long time ago? I ll bet Nadia Murad does. Our president should have lost his right to govern for not responding effectively to this threat. He and his liberal brethren just call people on the other side of the aisle racist and allow the bodies to continue to pile up due to their inept leadership.

Peter Soeller, a New York City student and civil rights activist, tweeted that he and approximately of his pals were attacked by Donald Trump supporters after they left a party on Saturday night, BizPac Review reports. According to Soeller, his buddies were merely walking down the street chanting and laughing when four or five Trump supporters suddenly appeared out of nowhere. The Trump supporters confronted us and assaulted us yelling, Blue Lives Matter Get out of my country, calling us faggots and commies as they wailed on us, Soeller tweeted. So, there were millennials on their way home from a Black Lives Matter party and not a single one of them had a cellphone to whip out and take a few seconds of video of the alleged beating? Millennials are rarely ever separated from their phones doing so could lead to them missing the chance for yet another inane selfie. It is beyond illogical to think college kids would leave for a night out and not one of them had a working phone. Soeller and his friends were on their way home from the Decolonize This Place party when they were allegedly stopped by a small handful of Trump supporters. Soeller claims he and two others were the most seriously injured. No more pettiness, time to organize, Soeller also said in his tweet. He claimed the roving mini horde of Trump supporters were trolling the streets looking for queer anti Trump activists. The anti police activist also made a baseless claim about the four or five attackers who supposedly beat up the millennials. Soeller claimed the Trump supporters were off duty cops. Why did Soeller leap to such a wild accusation? The build of the attackers and the way they took us down, convinced the college student the unknown men had to be police officers. Trump supporter attack stories appear to be all the rage since the election. The elusive Trump fans wander around city streets in search of millennials to whomp on at least that is what the snowflakes claim. One such story has already been debunked. A Muslim college student who claimed she was attacked by Trump supporters who hurled Islamic slurs at her was actually just trying to stay out of trouble with her strict parents. The Muslim girl had stayed out too late in the evening with her boyfriend and needed a sympathetic story to tell the folks. She went into great detail when describing the alleged attack to police officers, who quickly realized far too many holes existed in her tall tale. We ll just have to wait and see if such holes start piling up in this case. I m sure the involved police officers will be paying extra close attention in the case of this cop hating agitator and his friends, who couldn t take on four or five cop built guys.

He points out that it was the New York Times that broke the email story back in March of , with the latest batch of WikiLeaks emails indicating that the Clinton team has been scrambling ever since. Dobbs plays a clip of Obama lying about his knowledge of Clinton using a personal email account to conduct government business. lou dobbs clinton In an interview Obama was asked, Mr. president, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the US government for official business while she was Secretary of State? Obama responded with a blatant lie, saying, The same time everybody else learned it through news reports. Mr. Dobbs points out the fact that Everybody else, however, didn t believe the president when he said that. And Clinton s top aide, Cheryl Mills, certainly knew better. It was she who told Podesta, We need to clean this up, noting the president has emails from Hillary that do not say State.gov. Dobbs goes on to tell his audience that Clinton had just days earlier conspired with Obama to hold back emails despite being subpoenaed by Congress. In that instance Podesta cities executive privilege. Dobbs points out that March was also when the firm managing her server, Platte River Networks, deleted her email archive using Bleachbit, despite that subpoena. March was also the month that Clinton ally Terry McAuliffe suggested that the wife of a strategically placed FBI official run for the Virginia State Senate. He also donated , to her campaign and then promoted him to the number two position in the FBI, in charge of the Clinton investigation. Dobbs closes, saying, As I have always said, there are no coincidences when it comes to the Clintons, and these latest revelations show how far their corruption extends within our government in Washington DC.",

German Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing huge backlash in the aftermath of the terrorist attack that killed people because of her open immigration policies, as per The Sun. Many people are saying it is because of her that this attack took place, because of her sympathy for Muslim refugees seeking asylum in any country that will take them. But there s one problem with these refugees wherever they go, attacks, murders, and rapes are increasing. Anywhere where these migrants are, violence follows. It s not looking good for the chancellor, who is up for reelection soon. She may not even get a chance to do so with so many of the German people calling for her blood. Many are blaming her for these deaths of innocent people. These are Merkel s dead, said Marcus Pretzell, chairman of the Alternative for Germany party in the western state of North Rhine Westphalia. Klaus Bouillon of Merkel s CDU party also said to Saarland radio We must state that we are in a state of war, although some people who want to see only the good cannot see. Merkel was attending the ironically named International Day of Migrants when the attack took place, and she stated she was shocked and shaken by the tragedy that had taken place. Merkel can pretty much kiss her career goodbye. The German people are no longer as sympathetic to immigrants as some German politicians, due to the increase in assaults they are witnessing. Similar incidents have taken place in Ansbach, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Dusseldorf, Stuttgart, and Bielefeld. Merkel s opponents are sure to be gaining more popularity as more are leaning towards the right and calling for these refugees to be booted out of the country. Many European countries are regretting their decisions to let these migrants into their countries. This is why so many are intolerant of the Islamic faith and having these immigrants in their countries violence seems to follow them everywhere they go since for every three or four peaceful Muslims, there is one bent on destruction. Many other countries, including America, have seen increased attacks stemming from these migrants. They all need to go back to their own countries, plain and simple. It s like being in a destructive relationship they re already going to tear themselves down, but if you cut sling, you don t have to go down with them. And the American people are not going down with them. And I m sure that the German people don t want to go down either. Merkel is sure to not be elected next year for her fourth term as chancellor, especially with Pretzell laying the blame at her feet. It s time to cease the sympathy for Muslim migrants, because it s only hurting the countries that take them in.",

Bill Clinton stated that Trump knows how to get angry, white men to vote for him, and Trump responded by saying that Hillary Clinton s campaign focused too much on the wrong states, as per Fox News. Hillary s husband and the rest of the Democrats are pointing fingers everywhere except for at Hillary Clinton, who deserves it. The fact of the matter is that she ran a terrible campaign, and that s why she lost. You would think she would have done so much better, due to the fact that this wasn t her first rodeo, but it bombed. It was DOA. Dead. On. Arrival. Regarding Bill s statement that Trump called him after the election, Trump clarified that it was Bill Clinton who called him and offered a very nice congratulations. Donald Trump was elected because he ran a very successful, if unconventional, campaign. It was because of its unconventionality that it was so successful. The Trump campaign was a breath of fresh air to the American people, who were tired of the same old rickety career politicians who are dusted off and paraded around for the people to see. Hillary s campaign did focus on the wrong states and barely made any appearances. Donald Trump hopped from state to state, practically killing himself to make several appearances and running himself ragged to prove to the people he was their best choice. She failed to focus on states like Arkansas and states in the Midwest. She probably viewed them as beneath her and not worth her precious time. She was so sure that she was going to win that she didn t even bother trying to sell herself in enough states. The Clintons lost because of her and her campaign s mistakes, but who do they blame? They blame people like FBI Director Comey for reopening the investigation into Hillary s email scandal days before the election, which did hurt her numbers. But frankly, if you re going to complain about that, then try not performing illicit actions with government property and maybe you won t be in the situation in the first place. It s as simple as that, but the Democrats refuse to not think of themselves as victims. Donald Trump s response to Bill Clinton was absolutely perfect, and even more so because he put it on Twitter and sent it directly to the American people. Trump doesn t wait for the mainstream media to twist his words he delivers them himself. Trump is our president elect, and he was confirmed as the next president by the Electoral College on Monday. So, all the effort that liberals put forth to prevent this was for nothing they have, once again, failed. They can point fingers all they want and play the blame game, but it won t change the outcome that Trump is the president, and Hillary Clinton is not.",

While Rand Paul would have made a decent nominee, he came out in support of a major policy of the man who s been called upon to lead our nation. Let s not give in to Washington and its stagnated ways. Let s follow the lead of Presidents Reagan and Bush and help President Trump begin his administration with tax cuts for everyone and less money in Washington, Paul wrote in an op ed for Breitbart. We have tried it before, Paul wrote. In fact, the most successful Republican presidents and a few Democrats led off their agendas with tax cuts to send money back and to try to get government to live with a little less. Indeed, there have been two men who have shown how well tax cuts can play a role in stimulating our economy. These men were Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy. When we elected the youthful Kennedy to become our th president, he had little economic experience, and the nation was still in the doldrums of a recession in that rivaled the one of . He set out to determine how to get the country back on track. As Lawrence Kudlow and Brian Domitrovic wrote in Time, in Kennedy s first year in office, he at first tried the typical Democrat approach and instilled a number of spending approaches. However, growth was only at a stagnant . percent. He then had a change of heart and decided to push through a generous tax cut of percent. Although Kennedy never saw it to fruition before he was assassinated, LBJ decided to push it through as a memorial to the fallen leader. The tax cut became law in , and it started an uninterrupted run of eight years of consistent economic growth of at least five percent annually. One of Kennedy s other successors was a man named Ronald Reagan, who was intrigued by the Kennedy model of tax cuts. He devised his own plan, and it passed the Senate by a vote in . The nation enjoyed a long term growth rate of roughly four percent per year. In , the economy is not completely bleak, but it could be much better. The nation has had stagnant growth for much of the last two presidents terms, but as Rand Paul noted, even when George W. Bush attempted a modest tax cut, it gave the nation a boost for a period of time. In standing with Donald Trump s ambitious tax cut plans, Rand Paul is staying true to himself and to this model. Trump has proven so far that he is a person of his word, and his proposed tax cuts would give this country the prosperity it so richly deserves. If Trump doesn t follow through and it is just a read my lips moment, he will probably be a one term president. He has Paul s support, so hopefully we can get America back on the right path to making it, once more, Great Again. ",

        "text": "U.S. Agency for International Development s USAID worked in Afghanistan from July through June under the Obama administration. The work there included supporting Afghan health facilities. They spend nearly million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program. The logic seems sounds, in a country at war we can help by providing health care. Unfortunately, it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks. On the website, the USAID claims that during the current administration, The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations. This must be code for, We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them, because this is exactly what the group has done. Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction SIGAR John Sopko wrote to the agency, stating, One Afghanistan hospital funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development was located more than miles away from the listed coordinates, while another facilities were more than six miles away. The letter elaborated, SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at of facilities in Badakhshan an Afghan province but was unable to locate one facility. SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water. The money to help is going somewhere else Sopko went on to say that only of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided. This means that only about of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be. In some cases, the coordinates given were not even in the correct country, coordinates for of the facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID. Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan Afghanistan s neighboring country to the southeast. One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID. Others were miles from the reported coordinates, four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates, and another three were between three and six miles away. Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away, while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location. It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID. As SIGAR has stressed previously, robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided, Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith. A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem, The agency no longer maintains location data and obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government, which USAID was unwilling to make. Sopko countered this statement, USAID s position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling. W e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information, in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities. It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly. Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated, Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services. Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening, the agency will go on funding health centers, providing another million for the facilities. In turn, the United States will keep funding USAID. The bizarre circle of corruption will continue. USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward, USAID does not intend to maintain coordinates. They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities. Given this set of facts, the U.S. needs to withdraw its funding of the agency. Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though. The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition. W e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities, such as cracked walls, leaking roofs, broken doors, and shattered windows, which indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety. Inspectors also found exposed wiring. Electrical deficiencies, such as exposed live wires, pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff. Horrible conditions This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving. Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit. Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed. Millions more will be given before this funding runs out. Why is nobody in Washington asking questions? The answers will leave the White House with Obama. His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned, that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan. As usual, this is all lies. A more likely scenario, given what we know now, is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of health clinics was believable at the time. No more money should be sent to any program that Obama has started overseas. His close ties to terrorists should raise red flags for every American. President Trump needs to undo all of these projects so that we no longer operate maliciously, negligently, or in a corrupt manner.",

Putin said the Syrian rebels are mercenaries who only fight for whomever pays them more. While the president of Russia did not come out and say it is America arming them, he definitely, strongly hinted at it. Of course, this is the type of flawed leadership we have come to expect under the Obama administration. Putin s strong words have also, sadly, been confirmed by other sources. A Wikileaks report last August proved that Hillary actually lied under oath when she was asked about the weapons trade program that occurred with Syria starting a year before the Benghazi attacks. In the batch of leaked emails, an astonishing , of them were about Syria alone, as per The National Review. Something tells me this isn t the type of experience that the Clinton team was going for when they were squaring off against Trump, but this is also solid verification of Putin s statement. In Clinton s attempts to win what would essentially have been a third term for Obama, she would have contributed to the international discord and unrest we have all become painfully aware of. Let s get something absolutely clear in a world where America is not dominant on the world stage and where ISIS is allowed to grow stronger, those who love freedom lose. Those who believe in all our country s wonderful principles would soon see them slip away. The United States of America simply could not afford to have more of the same.

The forensic investigation into Obama s birth certificate reportedly proves the birthers were right all along! Jerome Corsi, Ph.D., a WND senior staff writer, is credited with forcing the Obama administration to release the document in the first place. Corsi s book, Where s The Birth Certificate?, first brought the Obama birth certificate issue to the public s attention. The Constitution requires a presidential candidate to be a natural born citizen but does not really define exactly what the entails meaning even though Obama was born to an American woman, he still might not have qualified to run for the highest office in the land. I was raised as an Indonesian child and a Hawaiian child and as a black child and as a white child, Obama once said, according to a report by the Miller Center. Obama spent four years of his childhood living in Indonesia with his mother and stepfather. Sheriff Joe Apraio s forensic investigation into Obama s birth certificate revealed the document presented to the public appears to be identical to and copied from another birth certificate issued in Hawaii just several days after he was born. The exceedingly similar birth certificate reportedly belongs to Johanna Ah nee. The items on the supposed Obama birth certificate, which appear to have been copied from the Johanna Ah nee birth certificate, include the word Honolulu, the word Oahu twice, two time stamps, and three different Xs. The identical appearance of the Xs was reportedly of particular interest to forensic investigators. The Xs would have been placed on the original birth certificate documents by moving a typewriter carriage and rolling over the certificate at the same time. Investigators reportedly found it interesting that the stamp made by Alvin Onaka and the April th stamp might have been lifted from another document. One of the expert forensic investigators who participated in the review of the Obama birth certificate was Reed Hayes. He is a court qualified document examiner and handwriting examiner. Reed Hayes also operates a business in Hawaii. He has been on the board of Scientific Association of Forensic Examiners for almost four decades. Forlabs, an Italian company which specializes in extracting details and information from multimedia files, produced the results of the Obama birth certificate forensic investigation. We had two experts from two countries in separate disciplines of forensics that came to one conclusion Barack Obama s long form birth certificate it not authentic, the report said. Mike Zullo, the lead forensic investigator involved with the report, quoted details from the investigation by Hayes The nail in the coffin that proves that Certificate of Live Birth is inauthentic is the exact lineup of numerous entries on both certificates . Zullo added the experts likened the evidence they found to prove the Obama birth certificate is a forgery to being as reliable as a fingerprint.",

According to Gersh Kuntzman, the murder of Karlov at the hands of a Turkish police officer shouting, Allahu akbar, and, Don t forget Aleppo, was not terrorism, but instead a noble act. As Vladimir Putin s man in Turkey, Karlov was the public face of that murderous dictator s war crimes around the globe and of oppression at home, Kuntzman claims. Andrei Karlov is the human embodiment of policies that deployed bunker busters to kill babies, sent fighter planes on scorched earth bombing runs that destroyed a whole city, aided Syrian madman Bashar al Assad in his campaign that has killed hundreds of thousands, and even ordered attacks on UN aid workers. Kuntzman, who was surprised his murder didn t come months ago, attempted to draw comparisons to the assassination of Ernst vom Rath, the Nazi ambassador to France. Like Karlov, Rath was the public face of atrocity in this case, Adolf Hitler s genocide, anti Semitism and coming global aggression, Kuntzman wrote, comparing Russia s role in Syria to Hitler s across multiple continents. After receiving backlash for the controversial piece, Kuntzman further defended his position on social media, arguing that Karlov was a soldier therefore shooting him in the back outside of a warzone was an appropriate move.",

        "text": "Back when Hussein Obama first befouled the White House, many naive Americans still gave him the benefit of the doubt in both his honesty and his declaration that he was a Christian. He s since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white hating Muslim agitator, but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time. WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer. There were those who knew what he was up to, but their silence had been purchased. One such individual was Preeta Bansal, who may or may not share Obama s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his. She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime, being a naturalized Indian. Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti white, anti American prejudice. bansal obama discrimination As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals, Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination, but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch. That s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ Civil Rights Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non white. Discriminating against whites and Christians is just who we are under this racist America hating Islamist. One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration. Race based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in. Being Arab alone wasn t enough to get you onto the good list. Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included. She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers. Two questions rise from that admission what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she, knowing their background difficulties, still include them as potential recruits? The WikiLeaks Podesta email from October of , forwarded to John Podesta, which contains the Bansal correspondence is linked here and below Fwd FW Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates From gaylesmithgayle gmail.com To john.podesta gmail.com Date Subject Fwd FW Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates Lists from Preeta attached.

From Bansal, Preeta D NYC Sent Monday, September , PM To Froman, Michael B Cc Onek, Matthew Subject Asian American Candidates, Muslim American Candidates Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs, sub cabinet jobs, and outside boards agencies policy committees. A couple things to note about the list of Muslim American candidates In the candidates for top jobs, I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim e.g., George Mitchell . Many Lebanese Americans, for example, are Christian. In the last list of outside boards commissions , most who are listed appear to be Muslim American, except that a handful where noted may be Arab American but of uncertain religion esp. Christian . There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a Secretary level job among the Muslim Americans. That said, on both lists, there are some very senior people listed in the last category for outside boards commissions who conceivably could be considered for top jobs. The very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly involved in politics or policy, or in the case of some Asian Americans, had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I thought we should seek new talent. But there s no magic to some of the placements. I think the lists are fairly exhaustive, but some of the people may be moved to other categories. High profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount of blogger criticism, and so the individuals on this list would need to be ESPECIALLY carefully vetted. I suspect some of the people I list would not survive such a vet but I do personally know, at least in part, virtually all of the candidates in the st two categories but I know very few of those listed for outside boards commissions . I listed the elected Muslim American democratic officials at the end of the second category, but for various reasons, I didn t think any of them would necessarily be suitable for an Administration appointment. Nevertheless, I wanted to flag them for you in case you wanted to evaluate them further.",

A robocall dialed out to hundreds of thousands of conservative voters on Tuesday warned of an imminent missile strike on several cities in Nevada, including the state capital, Carson City. The call prompted a mass evacuation of potential Republican supporters from the state and has been blamed for at least twenty five deaths. Just hours before the start of Nevada s Republican caucus, potential voters received a forty five second prerecorded phone call informing them that New York, Washington, and Los Angeles had just been obliterated by ballistic missiles. Evacuation orders have been issued for your state, the call calmly explained. You are to immediately report to your precinct s designated polling center for further instructions. The vast majority of those who received Tuesday afternoon s robocall perhaps out of fear of nuclear annihilation didn t stay on the line long enough to find out that the call had been paid for by Ted Cruz for President and, according to the Texas senator s campaign manager, was meant to merely warn voters of the dangers of a Trump presidency. In an interview with MSNBC s Chuck Todd, Senator Cruz said that such calls are common during primary season and accused his fellow candidates of forming a behind the scenes alliance in order to conduct a dishonest and misleading smear campaign against him. The senator expressed sadness over the tragic loss of at least two dozen potential voters who perished trying to flee a fictitious Nevadan Hiroshima but blamed his rivals for taking parts of the call out of context in order to discredit him at the expense of the good people of Nevada. Meanwhile, statements released by the Trump and Rubio camps called for a complete redo of the Nevada caucus. While Senator Rubio accused Cruz of denying people their constitutional rights Donald Trump complained that Cruz s deceptive tactics had likely cost him millions of votes.

        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. According to a new report scheduled for public release this week by the Government Accountability Office, President Obama s bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over billion in . Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took . bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less. By the GAO s estimate, the commander in chief spent just over eighty five hours in the bathroom in alone. The question on everyone s mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there? Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted to C SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day. Even so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record breaking twenty one minute bathroom break. I think it s very telling, Senator McCain said. The average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement. However, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta told Real News Right Now. Despite President Obama s low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above average amount of toilet paper and if he s a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the men s room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping . billion. This is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with. Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen in an effort to save taxpayers a buck or two, often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. It s uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, it s the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents. ",

Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and other members of the Islamic State s leadership council have provided more than five million dollars in campaign contributions to Republican presidential candidates this year, according to a campaign finance report released by the Republican National Committee last week. According to the report, more than half of the GOP s leading presidential contenders including Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have received upwards of one million dollars from the Islamic State. However, specific standards set in place by the Federal Election Committee limit individual donors to a maximum contribution of , per year. In addition, the FEC strictly prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution toward elections held in the United States. To the delight of the RNC, the Islamic State has found a convenient loophole to bypass these restrictions. Using the same global financial networks already in place meant to provide funding to its various terror operations, ISIS is able to funnel cash through a number of waypoints before it reaches sympathetic Americans residing in the United States. Then, using funds provided by the Islamic State, individuals simply write a check for the maximum donation allowed, payable to a presidential candidate s campaign. It s really an ingenious system, said James Arevalo, assistant campaign manager for Senator Ted Cruz. Obviously the senator doesn t see eye to eye with the Islamic State on some issues, Arevalo told CNN, continuing, That said, we certainly share very similar beliefs and values with ISIS, particularly when it comes to women s rights and gun control. Arevalo added that candidates have a moral obligation to meet the uphold the values of supporters and donors alike. In the wake of the nation s most recent mass shooting that left fourteen people dead and another twenty two injured in San Bernardino, California, the Republican party, at the request of the Islamic State and the National Rifle Association, once again blocked legislation that would enact stricter gun control policies in the United States. Currently there are an estimated , people on the U.S. government s terror watch list with several thousand residing in the United States. Legislation proposed by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein would have prevented terror suspects, felons, and individuals with a history of mental illness from purchasing firearms. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who opposed the legislation, told CBS This Morning that the act of blocking suspected terrorists and convicted felons from legally obtaining firearms would infringe upon the rights of law abiding citizens.

During a Democratic fundraiser in New York last Monday, President Barack Obama announced he has signed a contract with CNN to co moderate the fifth GOP debate with former Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Set for December th in Las Vegas, Nevada, the debate is tentatively focused on foreign policy. They need a little touch of reality, the president said, receiving a wide applause from the audience. This isn t an audition for the babysitter s club, it s the Oval Office. In the past, President Obama has publicly questioned whether or not the current Republican presidential hopefuls possess the intellectual and moral fortitude required to run the country. Presidential debates shouldn t be centered around catering to the candidates comfort level, said CNN political analyst Melissa Cunningham, referring to the most recent CNBC debate which prompted a failed attempt by the GOP to harness control of future debates. Cunningham continued, It ll be interesting to see how they field questions from a seasoned politician, particularly one that knows the ins and outs of the job they re vying for. Meanwhile, former Vice Presidential nominee and reality TV star Sarah Palin railed against the Obama administration for once again trying to sandbag the Republican party and suggested the president might be better suited leading a morning call to prayer. Former Daily Show host Jon Stewart, who many speculate will play good cop to President Obama s bad cop during the debate, visited the White House this week to brainstorm possible debate questions with the president.

Prominent Black Lives Matter activist and rapper Tef Poe has a message for white people If Donald Trump wins the presidency, niggas will incite riots everywhere . Dear white people if Trump wins young niggas such as myself are fully hell bent on inciting riots everywhere we go. Just so you know, Poe tweeted today. He followed up with another promise Trump wins aint no more rules fammo. We ve been too nice as is. Poe is by no means a nobody, he has appeared in innumerable articles charting the rise of Black Lives Matter and was credited with coining the phrase, This ain t your grandparents civil rights movement. The rapper was one of the co founders of Hands Up United, a social justice organization that emerged after the death of Michael Brown that was responsible for coordinating large BLM protests in the St. Louis area. St. Louis was hit by riots in August last year as police were forced to use tear gas to disperse demonstrators who threw bricks and bottles at officers. The hands up, don t shoot! mantra was later discredited by DNA and autopsy evidence that confirmed Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot by Officer Darren Wilson. Poe s threat to incite riots comes on the same day as it emerged that some of the radical groups involved in shutting down Donald Trump s rally in Chicago last week are planning a mass civil disobedience movement beginning next month. Donald Trump himself also warned that any attempt by the GOP establishment to steal the nomination from him may result in civil unrest. I think you would have riots.

ISIS is literally trying to totally eliminate entire populations of people who do not believe the way they do. When the House votes against Obama, you know there is something majorly wrong with the mentality of the White House. From Fox News The House approved a resolution Monday that declares the Islamic State is committing genocide against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East putting even more pressure on the Obama administration to do the same ahead of a deadline later this week. The resolution passed the House with a unanimous vote of . The resolution came to a vote just days after the release of a graphic new report by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians on ISIS atrocities. The report made the case that the terror campaign against Christians and other minorities in Syria, Iraq and other parts of the Middle East is, in fact, genocide. When ISIS systematically targets Christians, Yezidis, and other ethnic and religious minorities for extermination, this is not only a grave injustice it is a threat to civilization itself, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R Neb., said in a statement. We must call the violence by its proper name genocide. The resolution was voted on ahead of a congressionally mandated March deadline for Secretary of State John Kerry and the White House to make a decision on whether to make such a declaration. The measure is an effort to force the administration s hand on the issue, as the administration has so far declined to take an official position. There is a similar measure in the Senate that has yet to be voted on. Obama may want to protect Islam and disregard Christians, but it is abundantly clear there are hundreds of leaders in the House and Senate who do not agree with Obama s notions. If the resolution passes the Senate at a similar margin as the house, it will solidify the level of embarrassment our country feels toward Obama.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. AP Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order , which revokes the federal government s official recognition of the Pledge of Allegiance. Under the new order, it is now illegal for any federally funded agency to display the pledge or for any federal employee to recite, or encourage others to recite, the pledge while on duty. This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to , and up to one year in federal prison. During the press conference, the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to America s deepest held values. The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is, Obama said. Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah s Witnesses, Amish, Muslims, and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism. By calling this one nation under God , we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home. By saying liberty and justice for all , we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics, African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice. Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of under God runs afoul of the First Amendment s establishment clause. He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America s values. I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge, something that is includes everyone s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November s general election. She echoed his concerns about the pledge s language and suggested that the pledge s mention of God sends the wrong message to America s children. I fully support the President and the decision that he has made here today. In January, when I take office as the next President of the United States, unless I see otherwise, I will do my best to uphold this new law and ensure that it stays in effect. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump did not mince words when voicing his contempt for the president s order, referring to the president as an illegitimate Muslim traitor. As a Christian nation, the Pledge of Allegiance helps our children be the greatest children out there, the best there is, greater than all the other children in this world combined. Obama, who founded ISIS by the way, wants them not to be great, he wants them to be weak, and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools, he has proven that here today. This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January. We all must remember that this is one nation under God and not some guy and his beliefs in whatever he chooses to believe. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to ABC News about the ban. This is a story about President Obama banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much. Lawrence Ketchum of the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control. When our children are forced to chant, One nation under God , whose God are they referring to exactly? Ketchum said, From birth, children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control, efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be. The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values. Ketchum continued, This is a great day not just for Atheists, but for all Americans who value freedom. Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control. While Executive Order is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans, constitutional scholar, Paul Horner, told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged in court. Since this law only affects federal employees and contractors and not the general populace, it is well within the traditional scope of a president s executive authority to pass this law. Any challenges would lack proper legal standing and more than like be quickly dismissed. Fappy The Anti Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told ABC News he believes in what Utah is doing. It is important that children become the unique individuals that this country wants them to be. Conforming into the perfect little human beings that God intended them to be has always been the American way. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we ll burn in Hell for eternity. David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate aricles they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing. You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral, and we spend a minute or two debunking it, we make lots of money. Stories like this have helped put my children through college, buy a new car, a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy, Mikkleson said. We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well , but that s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I m only telling you this for legal reasons. Mikkleson continues, A typical story of ours makes wild claims, using grammatical errors, misspellings and words like umimumimaginative , recycled , hoax , saying that a story illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations , but we list no links or sources of information, they are all just outrageous accusations by us. And that story will get , shares or more on Facebook, that s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences. Mikkelson further explains, It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar, it s so funny! We also like to post fake, un funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories . But we don t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims It s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and as I said before, I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line so why do the extra work? Originally composed by Colonel George Balch in , The Pledge of Allegiance was later revised by Francis Bellamy in and formally adopted by Congress in . The Pledge is an expression of allegiance to the Flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The official name of the Pledge of Allegiance was adopted in and the last changes made to it came on Flag Day in when the words under God were added at a nursing school where CNA classes in Ann Arbor, Michigan were taking place. The Obama Administration has set up a hour hotline to address any questions and concerns the public may have regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is . Donald Trump plans to speak about the new law this Thursday night October th at PM at The Lost Leaf in Phoenix, Arizona.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C. AP Early this morning, President Obama made what could very well prove to be the most controversial move of his presidency with the signing of Executive Order , which makes it illegal to perform the national anthem at sporting events nationwide. Under the new order, it is now illegal to perform or recite the national anthem in any public venue. Because the anthem is primarily performed before sporting events, this is where the new order will have its biggest impact. Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to , dollars and up to one year in federal prison. The president said that his decision is a show of solidarity with the athletes who have been taking a knee during the anthem to protest police brutality. The President went on to say that the language used in the anthem is violent and hostile to African Americans. If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything, it s that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse. Our nation is being torn apart by a song, a song that is outdated and, jingoistic. Without swift action, we cannot move forward as a nation we cannot heal the wounds of racial division. How can we expect our police officers to stop killing African Americans when the very song of our nation is one that glorifies killing? Obama said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation. The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end, Obama said. We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming, not the nation we used to be. It has now been over two months since Kaepernick was first spotted sitting down as the national anthem was sung at a preseason NFL game because he refused to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. In a relatively short period of time, his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and sparked a debate not only about the state of race relations in America, but about what exactly it means to be a patriot. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of President Obama s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November s general election. She echoed his concerns about the anthem s militaristic language and called it one of the last remnants of slavery. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had some harsh words for both President Obama and democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over the new Executive Order. The hatred that President Obama and crooked Hillary have for this country really knows no bounds, Trump said at a press conference this morning in southern Iowa. I can tell you that when I m elected I ll have them both thrown in jail, and I ll make sure that they have to listen to the anthem in their jail cells all day long. I just hope we can stop them from rigging the election. Chicago Cubs third baseman Paul Horner said that he will refuse to play until the President s order is reversed. The national anthem is part of the game, Horner told ESPN. He might as well outlaw peanuts and crackerjacks. We always sing the anthem before we play ball, so if they aren t going to sing the anthem, I m not going to play ball. I think you re going to find that I m not the only one who feels this way. I ve already got at least ten teammates who are ready to join me in a show of solidarity. I really think we can start a trend here. The reaction to the new Executive Order has not been all negative, however. Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall, who has himself taken a knee in protest of the National Anthem, called this A great day not just for African Americans, but for all Americans who value freedom. He said that encouraging people to sing a song that contains such blatant nationalism and militarism makes us no better than North Korea , and causes the majority of Americans to behave like a pack of rabid, mind controlled zombies. Obama also managed to garner the support of MLB commissioner Rob Manfred. People like to watch sports because they provide a distraction from their day to day lives. the commissioner s office told CNN via e mail. There no need to taint that with political statements. I applaud the President s leadership on this difficult issue. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks, spoke to CNN about the ban. This is a story about President Obama banning the National Anthem at sporting events around the country, Bradley said. I just want to say a big thanks to every God fearing, Patriotic American that has supported our cause that gives brand new socks to the homeless. Please, donate what you can, every bit helps so much. Fappy The Anti Masturbation Dolphin, a mascot for a Christian organization that travels around the country educating children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, told CNN he disagrees with the President What the President really needs to do is put a ban on masturbation in this country. It is important to remember that our Lord and Savior loves each and every one of us, unless we masturbate, then we ll burn in Hell for eternity. While Executive Order is likely to be challenged in court, experts say it could be tied up for years, meaning that it is unlikely to be reversed before it takes effect on December st. In the meantime, they say to expect numerous protests from those who disagree with the president s decision. The Obama Administration has set up a special hour hotline to address any questions and concerns regarding the new Executive Order. The number for the hotline is .",

        "text": "Charleston, SC Just one day after the Democratic Primary, legendary actor, comedian, and writer, Bill Murray, brought his newly announced Presidential campaign to Charleston, South Carolina, speaking to an estimated crowd of over , cheering fans and supporters. Hello South Carolina! Are you ready to get weird or what? Murray said to the roaring crowd. Murray s speech, which lasted a little more than an hour, touched on many issues from his campaign, including increased wages, health care, the cost of higher education and human rights in general. The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke. I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach, Murray told the crowd. Here are grown men, candidates running for President of the United States, and they re acting like year olds. They re up there on stage, broadcasted to the entire world, calling each other names, interrupting each other, making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself I think the American people deserve better than this. I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this. Political analyst, Paul Horner, told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago. I don t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if he s just having some fun, but the man is making some excellent points out there. He s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it. I applaud Mr. Murray for what he s doing. I pretty much don t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now, Murray told the crowd, I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy, but the rest of em , are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion. Murray continued, I m always traveling around the world, but I m proud to call America, the good ole U.S. of A, my home. I think there s a lot of great people here, a lot of potential, but there s also a lot of confusion and hate right now. People don t know what to make of these Hitler wanna be s like Donald Trump, and the Ted Cruz s, who want to start World War III. They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has, and because of that, you see them leading in the polls. And it s sad that people go along with it, and can t see it for what it really is. Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President. We need a new face in Washington. Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can t be bought, Bradley said. I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless. Bill made a donation right there on the spot, saying what we were doing was amazing he s such a great guy. He truly cares about people and making the world a better place. Murray finished the rally by saying, I m no hero, I just want to help out, and I hope you all choose to stand behind me, or beside me, or wherever is comfortable for you, but just as long as it s with me. Look, we don t need to make America great again, because it already is we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man. I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that s sort of how you re supposed to live. Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible! Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican, Democrat or Independent. David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes, a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing. This type of story, when it goes viral, and we debunk it, we make money, Mikkelson said. The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one, it s actually quite simple. First, we start with the same cookie cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk. Next, we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours. After that, one of our writers will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted. And now, last but not least, we slap a title on there similar to the article s headline that we re debunking. This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story, and that s it! Then we just sit back and let the money roll in. We are the absolute definition of clickbait! I ll tell what, if it wasn t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner, putting out the stories that he does, my children wouldn t have been able to go to college. Holding back tears, Mikkelson finishes by saying, Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a fake news site , so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon. Murray s campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night. It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes. Tickets to that show are only .",

According to the report, which was obtained by The Washington Times, the nine individuals were arrested for providing or attempting to provide support to ISIS and included a police officer and several U.S. Army soldiers. The Washington Times reports Law enforcement agencies have arrested nine Northern Virginia residents on charges of aiding the Islamic State since the terrorist group rose to power in Syria and Iraq in and launched social media propaganda to attract followers, a government message to police states. Of the nine Northern Virginians who were arrested, all but one were in their teens and early s. They included a police officer, a Starbucks barista, Army soldiers, bankers and a cabdriver. Four of the nine graduated from Northern Virginia high schools, one with honors. Two attended Northern Virginia Community College. According to the Times, one of the men, a U.S. army combat engineer named Mohammad Bilor Jalloh, attempted to purchase firearms in an attempt to carry out a Fort Hood style attack. Another man, Metro police officer Nicholas Young, traveled to Libya and gave advice to Islamic State followers on how to avoid law enforcement monitoring according to law enforcement officials. Several others planned on creating online propaganda for the terror group, with one seeking to encourage lone wolf style attacks on Washington DC. The report raises new concerns about the reach of the terror group into the U.S. homeland, and any future plans to import new refugees from troubled Muslim nations.

She connects with that group, said Trump, and she ll be terrific. Did you see her at the Oscars? She was terrific as the Minority Outreach Director, so we brought her on board. We re lucky to have her. She s controversial, but she s one of the good ones. Dash recently created controversy by calling Grey s Anatomy actor Jesse Williams a plantation slave after his BET Awards speech calling for an end to racism and what he called cultural appropriation. Trump said now more than ever, especially with Crooked Hillary siphoning off my blacks, minority outreach is the difference between winning and losing in November. You know what will happen, said Trump. The media will come down on me for saying my blacks. They did that in California with that African American fellow in the crowd, but you know what? I don t care. Stacey will respond to all the groups we need to reach. One of those groups is the transgender community, Last June, the Clueless actress comments about bathroom use by transgender individuals created heated controversy. Dash said people who can t decide what they wanna be that day should go to the bathroom in the bushes. Sources say Trump s camp may even be vetting Dash for vice president. So far, Trump s short list includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and former House Speaker and presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. She s very well informed. She s quite affected. We ve been looking into it, said Trump. When asked if the term Negro was a proper term to use in , a Trump spokesman said, The trouble with saying African American is that not all blacks are from Africa, and some of them aren t even Americans. Some of them are from Central America, and even Puerto Rico. To be inclusive, we decided against colored, since the NAACP still uses that. We said no to black, because that sounded too polarizing. In the end, we went with negro. It s historically accurate. Nothing racist about it. Not everything is about race, added the spokesman. We hope Stacey Dash will make that fact clear to you people once and for all. UPDATE OMAROSA WILL NOT WORK WITH STACEY DASH",

Today a man from Trump s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event. I was given , to protest Donald Trump s rally in Fountain Hills, said year old Paul Horner. I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part. Trump supporters have been claiming that protesters are being paid by the Bernie Sanders campaign, but Horner disagrees. As for who these people were affiliated with that interviewed me, my guess would be Hillary Clinton s campaign, Horner said. The actual check I received after I was done with the job was from a group called Women Are The Future . After I was hired, they told me if anyone asked any questions about who I was with or communicated with me in any way, I should start talking about how great Bernie Sanders is. Horner continued, It was mostly women in their s at the interview that I went to. Plus, all the people that I communicated with had an AOL email address. No one still has an AOL email address except people that would vote for Hillary Clinton. Craigslist ad for Donald Trump protesters A screenshot of the Craigslist ad that Horner says he responded to. The actual ad has since been removed. Dennis System, File ABC News I knew those weren t real protesters, they were too organized and smart, said year old Tom Downey, a Trump supporter who attended the rally in Fountain Hills. I knew there was something up when they started shouting all these facts and nonsense like that. The best we could do was just yell and punch em and stuff. Downey continued, I think we did a good job though. I was shouting at them the whole time, calling them losers, telling them to get a job or go back home to mommy s house I got a bunch of high fives from my fellow Trump supporters. It was a great time. When asked about the other protesters at the rally, Horner said he saw most of them during the interview and training for the rally. Almost all of the people I was protesting with I had seen at my interview and training class. At the rally, talking with some of them, I learned they only paid Latinos , Muslims and African Americans . I don t think they were looking for any Asians. Women and children were paid half of what the men got and illegals received across the board. I think I was paid more than the other protesters because I was white and had taken classes in street fighting and boxing a few years back Sarah Bradley, a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward, a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she does not understand why Trump protesters would need to be paid. I ll protest that guy for free, Bradley said. Trump is creating a place for like minded, ignorant, bigoted, hate filled individuals to gather and unite. You wouldn t have to pay me anything to protest that. Bradley continued, Trump supporters are the last kind of people to donate socks to the homeless, they only care about themselves and their white race. I would love the day I ever see a donation from a Trump supporter, I think it would make me change my opinion about them. Horner said the group had a mandatory six hour training class that had to be completed before protesting at Trump s rally. During training we were taught chants to shout like Dump Trump and Trump Is A Racist , things like that. We were told how to respond to anti Trump comments too. If a Trump supporter said something about how great his wall will be, the Latinos in our group would say, We re just going to tunnel underneath it. They even gave me a shirt to wear at the rally which said F ck Donald Trump along with a sign to hold that said Make America White Again . David Mikkelson, founder of Snopes.com, a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue, told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing.

We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well , but that s just ridiculous. Do you know how much time that would take? Instead, we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours, write a couple sentences, and that s it. I just want to be clear, our website does zero journalism or anything creative, and I m only telling you this for legal reasons. For example, do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax exempt status? Did you actually read our story? Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax? What is the actual website URL? We claim to know it, but no real information is posted by us. Mikkelson continues, It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it. In one recent story of ours, we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar, oh the hypocrisy, but it is so funny at the same time! We also like to post fake, un funny, juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors, such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems. We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking, but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is fabricated. Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings, they could probably make a lot of money, Mikkelson laughs. And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are proven false, but since we block archive.org it just becomes their word versus ours. Plus, I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria, it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts it results in more visitors. Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories . The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for. We don t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims It s just more of our hack, unethical journalism, and I only tell you this for legal reasons. I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses, but we never say what website it actually is. I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea, and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism, but people will click our ads regardless, bottom line so why do the extra work? To be honest, I d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real, actual, work. ABC News reached out to Hillary Clinton s campaign for comment but did not receive a response.",

Trump managed to get word of the situation and decided to send a plane to help the stranded Marines. The way the story was told to us was that Mr. Trump found out about it and sent the airline down to take care of us. And that s all we knew .I remember asking Who is Donald Trump? I truly didn t know anything about him, Stickney said. Stickeny says that he and his family is forever grateful for lending a hand.

        "text": "A review of FBI Director James Comey s professional history and relationships shows that the Obama cabinet leader now under fire for his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton is deeply entrenched in the big money cronyism culture of Washington, D.C. His personal and professional relationships all undisclosed as he announced the Bureau would not prosecute Clinton reinforce bipartisan concerns that he may have politicized the criminal probe. These concerns focus on millions of dollars that Comey accepted from a Clinton Foundation defense contractor, Comey s former membership on a Clinton Foundation corporate partner s board, and his surprising financial relationship with his brother Peter Comey, who works at the law firm that does the Clinton Foundation s taxes. Lockheed Martin When President Obama nominated Comey to become FBI director in , Comey promised the United States Senate that he would recuse himself on all cases involving former employers. But Comey earned million in one year alone from Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin became a Clinton Foundation donor that very year. Comey served as deputy attorney general under John Ashcroft for two years of the Bush administration. When he left the Bush administration, he went directly to Lockheed Martin and became vice president, acting as a general counsel. How much money did James Comey make from Lockheed Martin in his last year with the company, which he left in ? More than million in compensation. Lockheed Martin is a Clinton Foundation donor. The company admitted to becoming a Clinton Global Initiative member in . According to records, Lockheed Martin is also a member of the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, which paid Bill Clinton , to deliver a speech in . In , Lockheed Martin won approvals for private contracts from the Hillary Clinton State Department. HSBC Holdings In , Comey became a board member, a director, and a Financial System Vulnerabilities Committee member of the London bank HSBC Holdings. Mr. Comey s appointment will be for an initial three year term which, subject to re election by shareholders, will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, according to HSBC company records. HSBC Holdings and its various philanthropic branches routinely partner with the Clinton Foundation. For instance, HSBC Holdings has partnered with Deutsche Bank through the Clinton Foundation to retrofit , to , housing units, primarily in the low to moderate income sector in New York City. Retrofitting refers to a Green initiative to conserve energy in commercial housing units. Clinton Foundation records show that the Foundation projected billion in financing for this Green initiative to conserve people s energy in low income housing units. Who Is Peter Comey? When our source called the Chinatown offices of D.C. law firm DLA Piper and asked for Peter Comey, a receptionist immediately put him through to Comey s direct line. But Peter Comey is not featured on the DLA Piper website. Peter Comey serves as Senior Director of Real Estate Operations for the Americas for DLA Piper. James Comey was not questioned about his relationship with Peter Comey in his confirmation hearing. DLA Piper is the firm that performed the independent audit of the Clinton Foundation in November during Clinton World s first big push to put the email scandal behind them. DLA Piper s employees taken as a whole represent a major Hillary Clinton campaign donation bloc and Clinton Foundation donation base. DLA Piper ranks on Hillary Clinton s all time career Top Contributors list, just ahead of Goldman Sachs. And here is another thing Peter Comey has a mortgage on his house that is owned by his brother James Comey, the FBI director. Peter Comey s financial records, obtained by Breitbart News, show that he bought a , house in Vienna, Virginia, in June . He needed a , mortgage from First Savings Mortgage Corporation. But on January , , James Comey and his wife stepped in to become Private Party lenders. They granted a mortgage on the house for , . Financial records suggest that Peter Comey took out two such mortgages from his brother that day. This financial relationship between the Comey brothers began prior to James Comey s nomination to become director of the FBI. DLA Piper did not answer any question as to whether James Comey and Peter Comey spoke at any point about this mortgage or anything else during the Clinton email investigation.",

According to Graham, who feels Trump has been chosen by God, the reality TV star was the only thing standing between Christians and death camps. The liberal Democrats are openly hostile to Christians, said Graham in an interview on WEHW radio. We won t survive four more years of Democrat led government. I can see them rounding Christians up and putting us in death camps unless we follow their laws that want to grant special rights to gays and transgender people. Christians need to vote for Trump, he embodies our values, said Graham. Apparently, many Evangelical Christians feel they are under siege. FOX News commentator Bill O Reilly has done several segments on the alleged War on Christmas. Right Wing Watch reported Carl Gallups, an End Times preacher, told World Net Daily that the U.S. government was currently at war with Christians. In my opinion, this particular election is right up there with the presidential elections before and during the Civil War, said Gallups. We are in a kind of societal civil war right now! And we are certainly in a great spiritual civil war in our nation, perhaps one like never before. Sharing is caring!",

Sacramento, CA Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is in hot water again after nearly million uncounted California electronic ballots were found on her email server by the F.B.I.

Ms. Clinton has already come under fire during this election cycle over using her private email server for personal use, including storing and sending classified information with it. There has been a formal investigation, but no charges have been filed in that case. Some of the charges are facing several charges. Ms. Clinton s public relations official released a brief statement saying, Hillary does not know how those ballots ended up on her server. We are conducting an internal investigation into the matter.

        "text": "Before running against billionaire real estate mogul Donald Trump for the presidency, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told an audience at a private, paid speech she wanted to see more successful businessmen and women run for office because they can t be bought. In a speech made public by Wikileaks which released an email from Hillary for America Research Director Tony Caark containing three attached speeches given at a private Goldman Sachs events Clinton spoke and took audience questions at the Builders and Innovators Summit hosted by Goldman Sachs on October , . Answering a question about businessmen in politics, Clinton said that they are most often the people that look over the horizon, and therefore share a vision that many politicians of today lack. And that s a very good question and thank you for asking it. Yes, I would love to see more businessmen go into politics because I believe they would bring in an entirely different mindset and strategies than what we re used to seeing traditionally, she opined. And then she just had to go on. In fact, when you say businessmen and women, I can t help but think of a particular one that I would just love to see running for the presidency at some point in the future, Clinton added. I don t know what it is exactly about him, I can t quite put my finger on it, but my instinct is almost never wrong. And it s telling me that Donald Trump would be very successful if he were to venture into politics in the future. Asked to elaborate on her statement, the former Secretary of State argued that she thinks that businessmen can t be bought and that they re very honest. And I think that goes especially for Donald Trump, whose successful projects and business ventures have made him synonymous with big business and, more importantly, creating thousands of jobs. I also think he understands the philanthropic and charitable side of things quite well, which is a crucial skill for any politician, she praised her current counter candidate. I think he has a lot to offer to this country and its people, especially when we re talking about the economy, she continued. Donald Trump has single handedly helped stop the recession, more so than dozens of other so called billionaires. And I don t know how the experts on the matter feel, but in my book that s hard evidence of the man s business prowess and integrity, as well. And I think everyone would agree those are commendable character traits for anyone looking to tackle the most difficult problems and challenges in the world, quite literally. So, yes Donald Trump is someone I could very easily see winning the support of the people. And I don t think he would do that with his flammable rhetoric and negotiation skills which are both things he s known for but with common sense and respect for his fellow countrymen. But, most of all I think his relationship with the opposite sex would bring him the most political points. I think he respects women and treats them as equals and I also think that would bring him a significant lead over anyone unlucky enough to be running against him, she ominously concluded in her speech.",

Pakistani businessman Tahir Javed hosted the reception for Clinton at this home in West Beaumont. Former U.S. Representative Nick Lampson, who attended the event, says people were there. Lampson says Clinton spoke about education, healthcare and individual freedoms for people of all backgrounds and faiths. Many of the Pakistanis at the event were pleased with Clinton s vocal support of the Muslim religion.

The island has been experiencing a population decline in recent years, and they decided to try to reach out to Americans seeking to flee our current political dystopia by offering a new place to live if the idea of Donald Trump and the Republicans following his lead are just too much. Mary Heanue, Inishturk s development officer, was quoted as saying I ve heard there are quite a few people in America looking to move to Ireland and other countries if Donald Trump becomes president. I d like them to know that we d love to see them consider moving over here. Our big concern is employment and trying to encourage families to move over here because the population is declining. The island featured on an Irish TV documentary last year which gave us great publicity and a good few extra bookings. But we ended up having a terrible summer and a lot of people canceled. They d be given a huge welcome and they d find this is a fantastic place to live and to bring up children. Their kids would probably get the best education anywhere in the country too, because the teacher to pupil ratio is nearly one on one. Although winters can be hard and it s the kind of life that wouldn t necessarily suit everyone, they d find it very peaceful here and they d soon find out there s nowhere as nice in the world on a summer s day than here. The website IrishCentral.com also got in on the action recently, by publishing their own guide on moving to Ireland in case Donald Trump is elected. The website describes the details, and realities, of moving to Ireland. It isn t particularly cheap and the financial restrictions on it might preclude some people from being able to take advantage of it. However, there are some big things on the plus side. The gun laws are restrictive and you won t see wannabe cowboys carrying handguns openly in Ireland a huge plus. They have strong social welfare and services, plus did I mention universal heathcare? Not exactly a terrible idea They also do take some well placed digs at our Republican problem, by making a few short jabs at the likes of Bill O Reilly and Donald Trump in particular, by stressing that you request an absentee ballot so you can still vote against Donald Trump for a nice middle finger from across the pond. More than likely, Trump will not get elected. However, it never hurts to have a backup plan, especially if you don t fit into one of the new state approved ethnic groups whites only that will be one of the features of a possible Donald in the White House.",

Supposedly, it was love at first sight a sexual relationship that lasted years through high school although she says they didn t have sex until after graduation , Bill s law school at Yale, his years as Arkansas governor, and until his entrance into the White House. Dolly Kyle in Dolly Kyle in This is what Dolly Kyle wrote in her book source Daily Mail In , Bill Clinton had had , sex partners Dolly said she started sleeping with Bill after high school and admits Billy was a sex addict I was a codependent .

Bill told Dolly, That s ten times more than I ve had! which meant Bill had sex with , women in , which means that the number would be even higher by . Hey, Dolly Kyle, that s some love Bill Clinton had for you! Bill Clinton had wanted to be president since high school Bill first confessed his desire to be president to Dolly back in high school, and began actively pursuing it after the summer of when, as an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, he had a photo op with President John F Kennedy in the Rose Garden. Bill Clinton called blacks niggers Dolly wrote that she frequently had heard Bill refer to blacks in the South as G damn n r . Bill Clinton never used a condom, but seemingly was unconcerned because, as he told Dolly, he had a low sperm count. Note Other reports say Bill Clinton is sterile from mumps. It was a marriage of convenience of Bill and Hillary using each other Hillary s role was financial provider to get Bill elected president, and pursue his addictions to politics, power and sex . Bill s mother, too, had supported the family financially while his stepfather drank. Dolly wrote Hillary s role of providing financial security for Billy was part of her motivation for the series of financial crimes yes, crimes that she committed over the decades. Hillary was upholding her part of the deal to get Billy elected president, after which it would be her turn to be the first woman in the Oval Office. Bill Clinton called Hillary his warden Hillary kept Bill s nose clean in the public mind and had private investigators tracking Bill and the women he was dating or attacking because she was riding his coattails to political power. Dolly writes Hillary needs the power and she is ruthless. College age Hillary Clinton College age Hillary Clinton Hillary was sweaty and had hairy calves and toes Dolly first met Hillary on the evening of May , at the airport in Little Rock. It was election night and Senator William Fulbright was running for re election. Fulright was Bill Clinton s champion giving Bill his first Senate job while Bill attended Georgetown University supporting him for the Rhodes Scholarship and a teaching job at Arkansas Law School introducing him to powerful people in Washington and financial backers for Bill s first congressional campaign that he eventually lost. Dolly describes Hillary as a dowdy looking woman who appeared to be middle aged with thick eyebrows melded together stretching across her forehead, wearing coke bottle thick lenses and a misshapen, brown, dress like thing that must have been intended to hide her lumpy body. The garment was long, but stopped too soon to hide her fat ankles and her thick calves covered with black hair. Thick brown sandals did nothing to conceal her wide feet and the hair on her toes . Hillary glared at Dolly with hostility. Dolly writes In that moment, I noticed that the woman emitted an overpowering odor of perspiration and greasy hair. I hoped that I wouldn t gag when she got in the car. When Bill introduced the dowdy woman as Hillary, Dolly was stunned and thought it was some kind of a sick joke a woman in a hideous disguise. Bill discarded his mentor benefactor Sen. Fulbright when the latter lost reelection Dolly writes that although the plan had been to go the Fulbright s campaign headquarters, when the votes came in showing he was losing, Hillary signaled to Bill and the plan was changed. He would head back to the airport. Bill told Dolly, I don t want to be seen with a loser. Hillary s attempt to carve a political career for herself in Washington sizzled A lawyer and graduate of Yale, Hillary wanted a career in Washington but she flunked the DC bar exam. Dolly writes that at the time of her meeting Hillary for the first time, Hillary was working in Washington, DC and trying to become a political force under her own steam. But It was a futile attempt and Hillary s job with the Watergate investigation ended. Dolly believes Hillary showed the same lack of integrity there that would later get her into more serious trouble. See Hillary Clinton was fired for lying when she was years old Hillary was a lesbian Although Bill did not use the word lesbian, he hinted at it by keep referring to Hillary s lifestyle . In March , Bill told Dolly he wanted a child but had a low sperm count We need to have a baby so we can appear to be a normal couple. We need to do something serious to take attention off the Warden s lifestyle. He asked Dolly to pray for a baby. Dolly suggested he had to bite the bullet and sleep with Hillary. Within a year, Chelsea Victoria Clinton was born and Bill fell head over heels with the little baby. See Bill Clinton not Chelsea s biological father Chelsea Clinton l and Wester Hubbell Chelsea Clinton l and Wester Hubbell But Hillary felt trapped being at home with a baby and couldn t wait to get back to work. She asked her friend, Louise How long do I have to stay at home with this kid? Hillary stayed home with baby Chelsea for three months before returning to work. Bill told to Dolly that it was the baby that kept the couple together. Hillary s other attractive qualities Hillary resented that she had to dress like Southern women she visited dress shops but generally didn t buy anything. Dolly also confirms Secret Service agents accounts of Hillary s foul mouth, anger towards the White House and Arkansas governor security detail, and physical abuse of Bill. In Arkansas, she had hissy fits and threw dishes at Bill in the kitchen, breaking a kitchen cabinet door. When Bill lost the governorship after one year, Hillary was furious, knowing that she was no longer the state s First Lady and had to move out of the governor s mansion and into a tiny house. See Ex Secret Service agent Jekyll Hyde personality makes Hillary unfit to be President Dolly writes Hillary is not a leader. She is a coattail clutcher who has a litany of jobs with no accomplishments, having failed as co president, failed as senator unless you are impressed with the bills she introduced to name a couple of post offices, failed as secretary of state and as a defender of women over the past years. Hillary instigated threats on women who had sex with her husband, a serial sex abuser. Dolly s summary opinion of the Clintons Despite her long, year sexual it s true love! relationship with Bill Clinton, Dolly Kyle has only contempt for the Clintons. She writes Billy and Hillary Clinton continue to be lying, cheating, manipulative, scratching, clawing, ruthlessly aggressive, insatiably ambitious politicians who are giving public service a bad name and nothing about them has changed in the past forty plus years, except that they have deluded more and more people. The Clintons and their misled supporters have rewritten history to suit their political agenda, which is to get votes to get power to get money to get more power to get more money. The Clintons vicious cycle of intertwining greed and power addictions will have no limit, unless someone stands up and announces. The emperor has no clothes! Ideology, integrity, and love of country were never involved in the Billary quest for the White House. It was always a codependent, co conspiratorial grab for money and power and more money and more power. Unfortunately for them and for the United States of America, there is never enough to satisfy addicts. ",

I ve spent years trying to stop bullying, in life and online, with children, teens, and adults, so what kind of message would it send if I voted for Donald Trump? asked Lewinsky. I understand that there are some weird ramifications of me voting for my former lover s wife, but you know, those were different times. That dress has long since been burned, if you know what I mean. Lewinsky says that she had originally thought about voting for Jill Stein, but Stein s anti vaccine sentiment made her think better. It s definitely a woman s place to be in the Oval Office, behind the resolute desk, and I don t just mean on her knees, said Lewinsky.",

Former first lady Nancy Reagan, who died on March at the age of , remained mentally alert until the very end, according to a private nurse, who told reporters Mrs. Reagan s last words to her were, Do not vote for Donald Trump. She watched all the GOP debates, said the nurse, identified as Althea Thoone. She was very alert and kept up with all the news and current events, especially about the election. She said no true Republican would cast a vote for Donald Trump. She was not happy at all because I don t believe she thought Donald Trump was a real Republican. She took a turn for the worse after the th debate when he started talking about his private parts, and all that other nonsense about Mitt Romney getting down on his knees. During the debate held on March , Trump responded to Romney s public attack against him by saying, He was begging for my endorsement. I could have said, Mitt, drop to your knees. He would have dropped to his knees. Trump also alluded to the size of his penis during the debate, responding to a joke about the size of his hands told by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The so called th Commandment, Thou shalt not speak ill of another Republican, once espoused by Ronald Reagan, now seems to be a relic from the past, when a kinder, gentler political sensibility existed in Washington, at least between members of the same party. He broke that commandment, and a few others too, as far as I m concerned, said Thoone, who became somewhat of a confidant to Mrs. Reagan in her last years. She remembered that crack he made about her not being very beautiful too. I wouldn t say Donald Trump caused her to pass, because that s up to the Lord, but he certainly didn t help any. She couldn t believe what she was seeing and hearing up there. She would just look over to me and shake her head. Thoone reports that Mrs. Reagan hoped to attend at least one of the GOP debates, but the strain of travel and her advanced age prevented such a trip. She was happy to see George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara at the Feb. debate, says Thoone. Mrs. Reagan s last public appearance was on July , , at her th birthday celebration.",

According to sources within the Department of Defense speaking under anonymity, Clinton likely violated at least two Dept. of Defense SAP protocols during the debate by announcing on live television the United States Government s response time for a nuclear launch.To the dismay of intelligence officials, the fact that this top secret information is now publicly known not only proves that Clinton is unfit to be commander in chief, but it also poses a direct threat to national security. One high ranking intelligence official explained that any time frame calculated pertaining to a US nuclear launch would have merely been an educated hypothesis, absent leaked documents and there have been no such breaches prior to Clinton s admission Wednesday. Via TruePundit Secretary Clinton proved tonight she is unfit to be commander in chief, a top ranking DOD intelligence source said. What she did compromises our national security. She is cavalier and reckless and in my opinion should be detained and questioned so we can unravel why she did what she did. According to Pentagon sources, the information Clinton disseminated publicly is Top Secret intelligence governed under the U.S. Special Access Program SAP which dictates safeguards and protocols for accessing and discussing highly classified and Top Secret intelligence. The specific details of the country s nuclear response time discussed by Clinton, sources said, are only known by a handful of individuals outside top military brass Targeting options by ICBM intercontinental ballistic missiles , air or sea, launch order, launch procedures and response are some of the most secretly guarded tenets of national security and nuclear war policy, a Pentagon source said. It s truly incredible that nuclear response time as part of an ERO Emergency Response Option is now out there in the public domain to our adversaries. U.S. Defense sources said according to developed U.S. counterintelligence, military officials in China, North Korea, Syria, Russia, Iran and even actors like ISIS had no previous definitive intelligence to determine the U.S. nuclear response time, especially during an ERO, prior to Clinton s admission Wednesday night. Sources reluctantly acknowledged her calculations were accurate.",

The synod experience also made us better realize that the true defenders are not those who uphold its letter, but its spirit not ideas but people not formulas but free availability of God s love and forgiveness, Pope Francis said. I see in Senator Bernard Sanders a man of great integrity and moral conviction, who understands these principles and genuinely wants what s best for all people The pope went on to criticize ultra conservatives, saying church leaders should confront difficult issues fearlessly, without burying our heads in the sand. It was the latest in a series of admonitions to bishops by the pontiff, who has stressed since his election in that the . billion member Church should be open to change, side with the poor, and rid itself of the arrogance and unfettered narcissism that has alienated so many Catholics in recent years. Naturally, conservative Catholics are not happy with Francis for being so outspoken on social issues and American politics. The pope needs to stick to religion, and stay the hell out of politics, says Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali. Conservative Catholics are losing faith in the Church, and this falls directly on the shoulders of Pope Francis with his socialist ideology and warped political views. Conservative news outlets like Fox News have taken issue with Pope Francis on everything from climate change to income inequality. Bill O Reilly has numerous times compared Pope Francis to Bernie Sanders, accusing both of being false prophets. Liberals and progressives on the other hand applaud the pope for bringing social and environmental issues to the forefront of the Catholic Church. He s a Catholic rockstar, says Prudence Bradley, , from upstate New York. Pope Francis has made it cool to be a Christian again. ",

The Clinton campaign needed Bernie Sanders on board before the emails were leaked as they contained evidence that confirmed his suggestions of Democratic establishment bias and would have given him unstoppable momentum heading into the convention had he chosen to play that game. The Kremlin have threatened to release , emails that Russia have hacked from Hilary Clinton s email server. Kremlin To Release , Hacked Hillary Clinton Emails However after the meeting with the Clinton team Sanders unexpectedly suspended his previously gung ho campaign, and although he refused to wholeheartedly endorse her, he signalled to his supporters that his run for President was effectively over. Kremlin sources have denied the DNC claims that Russian state sponsored hackers are behind the email leaks, with Julian Assange also stating the DNC claim is a politically motivated lame conspiracy smear. Despite the FBI asking the Kremlin for copies of any emails they have in their possession, it is understood the Kremlin has not released anything to anyone, including Wikileaks. According to Kremlin sources, the source of the Wikileaks email trove could have come from a huge number of possible sources , as intelligence communities around the whole world have copies of Hillary s emails. Everybody is talking about them. Senior staff in the Kremlin have been allowed to see the emails, however Putin alone has access to them and keeps them on his personal laptop, under lock and key. He has been heard staying up until am, reading their contents out loud, roaring with laughter. President Vladimir Putin is said to be amused by Democratic Party attempts to portray him as the villain, when their own failings are on display for all to see. They always need a babayka boogeyman to frighten people with. I am the Eastern boogeyman, it seems. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reached out to the Kremlin, promising them rewards if they release Hillary Clinton s missing emails. Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the , e mails that are missing, Trump said on Wednesday. I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let s see if that happens. That will be next. President Vladimir Putin s spokesman, while not directly denying Russian involvement in the hack, said Moscow would never interfere in another country s election. President Putin more than once has said that Russia would never interfere and does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, especially in the electoral process, Dmitry Peskov told journalists Wednesday in a conference call. Peskov also criticized the willingness to accuse Russia of wrongdoing. If we talk about some sort of suspicions against a country, then it is necessary at a minimum to be precise and concrete, the spokesman said. He said speculation in this case does not show a constructive attitude. ",

But televangelist Pat Robertson has taken it one step further. He believes Trump is on par with Jesus Christ. God came to me in a dream last night and showed me the future, said Robertson. He took me to heaven and I saw Donald Trump seated at the right hand of our Lord. According to Raw Story, Robert Jeffress, pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, a , member megachurch, said Trump would make a better candidate than Jesus. You know, I was debating an evangelical professor on NPR, and this professor said, Pastor, don t you want a candidate who embodies the teaching of Jesus and would govern this country according to the principles found in the Sermon on the Mount? said Jeffress. I said, Heck no. I would run from that candidate as far as possible, because the Sermon on the Mount was not given as a governing principle for this nation.

In an exclusive interview with the Hollywood Inquirer, Rupaul said that Mr Trump made a move on him during an event celebrating the release of the movie To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. The artist was wearing his full drag queen apparel at the time, and he says Trump clearly mistook him for a real woman. I had just come out of the bathroom when Trump jumped on me and kissed me , he explained. He started grabbing my ass and pulled my dress up to grab my genitals. He suddenly became very angry. He started yelling and cursing, and he left the party. Rupaul says he was dressed very sexy for the party and is convinced that Trump thought he was a woman. Rupaul says he found Donald Trump attractive before this incident, but that he was shocked by his rudeness and vulgarity. Rupaul told the Hollywood Inquirer that Donald Trump moved on him during a party, grabbing his ass and genitals. He just wanted to use me as an object, he told Hollywood Inquirer. I ve never felt so dirty in my life! In a way, I was saved by the fact that I m a man. This allegation from Rupaul adds to the wave of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior concerning Donald Trump. Many women have come forward over the last week to denounce the abusive groping and sexual harassment they suffered from Trump over the years. The New York Times published an article earlier this week, in which Trumps s alleged victims described the mistreatment they suffered. All these allegations came after Trump bragged about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women who were not his wife on recordings from obtained by The Washington Post and NBC News. The comments were part of a conversation with Billy Bush, then a host of the television show Access Hollywood. The remarks were captured by a live microphone that Trump did not appear to know was recording their conversation. You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful I just start kissing them.

All across the country Sanders core infrastructure of volunteers and paid staff are mobilizing to collect signatures and perform necessary paperwork to get him on the general election ballots in the states. Officials highly placed within the Sanders campaign remain evasive and deny that the senator plans, at this time, to run as an independent. Sanders campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, has stated time and time again that they intend to go all the way to the convention and make the case that Sanders should be the Democratic nominee for the general election. But the Sanders campaign is actively engaging in activities, within the states, that have no other purpose besides putting Sanders in the position of being able to run as an independent candidate against Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. If Sanders were to run in the general election, as the evidence of his campaign s actions point to, it could disastrously impact Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton s ability to win against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump. With present polling showing Clinton ahead of Trump in the general election by only six points, even a small split of democratic democratic leaning independent voters would virtually guarantee a Trump victory and presidency. And with divisiveness and disunity within the Democratic party over policy direction and candidate choice at an all time high, polling experts say Sanders could syphon off as much as of the democratic vote in a candidate general election. Many of Sanders supporters have been openly and vocally calling for the senator to run as an independent if he fails to secure the Democratic nomination. Citing unfair favouritism toward Clinton by the DNC under Debbie Wasserman Schultz, highly suspicious deviations between primary exit polling and election results, Sanders supporters have made the argument that the systematic corruption within the Democratic party will not allow progressive ideas and platforms to flourish if the party elite believe they can act with impunity and still count on the vote of progressives. It has been reported that Sanders is privately supportive of this type of analysis, and his coming independent candidacy will be engineered to force the party to the left, going forward, if they wish to compete against Republicans on a national level. Sources within the Sanders campaign, speaking on conditions of anonymity, say that Sanders has indeed been seriously considering an independent run, and wishes to ensure the option is available to him by performing the necessary work now. If Sanders were to wait until after the convention to lay the legal foundation for an independent run it would be too late. It is this fact that explains the Sanders campaign s actions toward inclusion on state ballots as an independent at this time.",

Given the stakes in the outcome of the American presidential elections, ensuring the integrity of the electoral process is of the utmost importance. Are the results we are witnessing in the primary elections trustworthy? While Donald Trump enjoyed a clear and early edge over his Republican rivals, the Democratic contest between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernard Sanders has been far more competitive. At present, Secretary Clinton enjoys an apparent advantage over Sanders. Is this claimed advantage legitimate? We contend that it is not, and suggest an explanation for the advantage States that are at risk for election fraud in systematically and overwhelmingly favor Secretary Clinton. We provide converging evidence for this claim. First, we show that it is possible to detect irregularities in the Democratic Primaries by comparing the states that have hard paper evidence of all the placed votes to states that do not have this hard paper evidence. Second, we compare the final results in to the discrepant exit polls. Furthermore, we show that no such irregularities occurred in the competitive election cycle involving Secretary Clinton against President Obama. As such, we find that in states wherein voting fraud has the highest potential to occur, systematic efforts may have taken place to provide Secretary Clinton with an exaggerated margin of support.",

We ll be asking for a monetary settlement and for those protestors to be prosecuted. It was very, very wrong of them. I do not condone violence. I m very against violence, especially at my campaign events. Trump s attorneys drew extensive papers on the lawsuit and are filled on Monday. A Chicago judge will review them by next week. Chicago violated my First Amendment right and they aren t going to get away with it. Just like China won t get away with stealing our jobs and manipulating their currency. The campaign thinks a conspiracy might be involved with the anti trump protesters. When the cops saw a bunch of black people entering my rally, they knew they shouldn t be there but let them in anyway. I mean, what the Hell is that? Trump then went after Chicago s Mayor Rahm Emanuel. I know Rahm thinks he s a tough guy, but he ll be a mouse looking for his mom by the time I get done with him. He makes Little Rubio look like a giant. A New Yorker will beat a Chicagoan every time. Believe me, he is going to regret not having his city under control. He was terrible as Obama s Chief of Staff and he s been a terrible Mayor. Look at the gang problem and the cities credit rating. I m happy Nabisco closed that Chicago factory and moved it to Mexico. I was against it before, but after tonight, I m totally for it. The Mayor Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the lawsuit frivolous and ridiculous. You can t have a presidential candidate going around suing cities because the local people don t like the guy, Emanuel told the Chicago Tribune. The city is in massive debt and the last thing we need is to be tied up in court for years to come cause we know Trump loves to sue people. Legal fees aren t cheap. Trump claimed the Chicago Police Department told him to call off the event but they responded by saying it was Trump s campaign that called off the event and the Chicago Police did not infringe on his free speech right. If Trump thinks he can bully the City of Chicago, he s got another thing coming. ",

Donald Trump has sent the Internet into a frenzy again today by adding a new stipulation for people that come to see him speak at his campaign rally s and it s called the Brown Paper Bag Test For those unfamiliar with the brown paper test, it s where the skin tone of African Americans were visually measured against an actual brown paper bag individuals lighter than the bag were labeled with more positive attributes compared to dark skin males and females. The Brown Paper Bag Test The Brown Paper Bag Test It gained popularity after the abolishment of slavery in and unconsciously, this test still seems to exists within the black community, especially when it comes to dating. Preference is natural in any aspect of life but within the black community bias stereotypes can fog decisions and lead to unhealthy relationships. Now Donald Trump has decided to use this test at all future campaign rally s and if you are not lighter than the brown paper bag you will not gain entry into any of his Pep Rally s. Trump released a statement saying IT S NOT ABOUT BLACK OR WHITE, IT S ABOUT RICH AND POOR, CLASS AND NO CLASS, WHICH SIDE ARE YOU ON? I M ON AMERICA S SIDE AND I WILL MAKE HER GREAT AGAIN ",

        "text": "Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is a controversial character. But there s no denying the emails he has picked up from inside the Democrat Party are real, and he s willing to expose Hillary Clinton. Now, he s announcing that Hillary Clinton and her State Department were actively arming Islamic jihadists, which includes the Islamic State ISIS in Syria. Clinton has repeatedly denied these claims, including during multiple statements while under oath in front of the United States Senate. WikiLeaks is about to prove Hillary Clinton deserves to be arrested The Reagan administration officials hoped to secure the release of several U.S. hostages, and then take proceeds from the arms sales to Iran, to fund the Contras in Nicaragua. Sounds familiar? In Obama s second term, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton authorized the shipment of American made arms to Qatar, a country beholden to the Muslim Brotherhood, and friendly to the Libyan rebels, in an effort to topple the Libyan Gaddafi government, and then ship those arms to Syria in order to fund Al Qaeda, and topple Assad in Syria. Clinton took the lead role in organizing the so called Friends of Syria aka Al Qaeda ISIS to back the CIA led insurgency for regime change in Syria. Under oath Hillary Clinton denied she knew about the weapons shipments during public testimony in early after the Benghazi terrorist attack. In an interview with Democracy Now, Wikileaks Julian Assange is now stating that , emails contained in the Clinton cache directly connect Hillary to Libya to Syria, and directly to Al Qaeda and ISIS. Via The Duran Here is the incredible transcript JUAN GONZ LEZ Julian, I want to mention something else. In March, you launched a searchable archive for over , emails and email attachments sent to and from Hillary Clinton s private email server while she was secretary of state. The , pages of documents span the time from June to August , of the documents were sent by Hillary Clinton herself. The emails were made available in the form of thousands of PDFs by the U.S. State Department as the result of a Freedom of Information Act request. Why did you do this, and what s the importance, from your perspective, of being able to create a searchable base? JULIAN ASSANGE Well, WikiLeaks has become the rebel library of Alexandria. It is the single most significant collection of information that doesn t exist elsewhere, in a searchable, accessible, citable form, about how modern institutions actually behave. And it s gone on to set people free from prison, where documents have been used in their court cases hold the CIA accountable for renditions programs feed into election cycles, which have resulted in the termination of, in some case or contributed to the termination of governments, in some cases, taken the heads of intelligence agencies, ministers of defense and so on. So, you know, our civilizations can only be as good as our knowledge of what our civilisation is. We can t possibly hope to reform that which we do not understand. So, those Hillary Clinton emails, they connect together with the cables that we have published of Hillary Clinton, creating a rich picture of how Hillary Clinton performs in office, but, more broadly, how the U.S. Department of State operates. So, for example, the disastrous, absolutely disastrous intervention in Libya, the destruction of the Gaddafi government, which led to the occupation of ISIS of large segments of that country, weapons flows going over to Syria, being pushed by Hillary Clinton, into jihadists within Syria, including ISIS, that s there in those emails. There s more than , emails in Hillary Clinton s collection, that we have released, just about Libya alone.",

According to sources, Randall Prince, a Columbus area electrical worker, was doing a routine check of his companies wiring and electrical systems when he stumbled across approximately one dozen black, sealed ballot boxes filled with thousands of Franklin County votes for Hillary Clinton and other Democrat candidates. No one really goes in this building. It s mainly used for short term storage by a commercial plumber, Prince said. So when Prince, who is a Trump supporter, saw several black boxes in an otherwise empty room, he went to investigate. What he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state. Early voting does not begin in Ohio until October , so no votes have officially been castin the Buckeye state. However, inside these boxes were, what one source described as, potentially tens of thousands of votes for Hillary Clinton. Christian Times Newspaper has not yet been able to obtain a photocopy of one of the ballots found inside the box, but an affiliate in Ohio passed along a replica of what was found.",

        "text": "The suspicious circumstances surrounding the death last week of former U.N. President John Ashe had many wondering whether foul play was involved. The New York Post s Page Six reported that after Ashe was found dead Wednesday, the U.N. claimed that he had died from a heart attack. Local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, later disputed that claim, saying instead that he died from a workout accident that crushed his throat. Adding to the mysterious nature of Ashe s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly. According to an unidentified source who spoke with Page Six, prosecutors had intended to use the latter fact to link Ashe directly to Democrat front runner Hillary Clinton, with whom he could be seen schmoozing in the picture above. It would have been very embarrassing, the source added. His death was conveniently timed. There was no evidence at the moment to corroborate the source s theory of foul play, but that certainly did not stop conspiracy theorists from theorizing about what really happened. Those theorists inclined to believe the stories about Hillary and Bill Clinton ordering the murders of their opponents wondered whether the former U.N. president was merely their latest victim However, Ashe s own lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, strongly disagreed with these theories. TRENDING STORIES Trump Ditches Media, Walks Into Restaurant Tells Diners He s Lowering Their Taxes, Gets Explosive Applause SHOCK Insider Reveals Bill Blames Hillary for Loss Media Dumbfounded Insider Reveals Hillary Got So Violent After Losing Extreme Measures Had to Be Taken There is not one iota of evidence that it was homicide, he reportedly said. This is nothing at all like Vince Foster. The late Vince Foster was a deputy White House counsel who died by gunshot in after he allegedly committed suicide. Conspiracy theorists have maintained for years that his death was in fact a murder one spearheaded by Hillary Rodham Clinton. No definitive evidence was ever procured to prove this theory, but that didn t stop them then, and it likely won t stop them now.

        "text": "Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that the mainstream media and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have been using to criticize Donald J. Trump, has deep ties to the government of Saudi Arabia and to international Islamist investors through his own law firm. In addition to those ties to the wealthy Islamist nation, Khan also has ties to controversial immigration programs that wealthy foreigners can use to essentially buy their way into the United States and has deep ties to the Clinton Cash narrative through the Clinton Foundation. Khan and his wife Ghazala Khan both appeared on stage at the Democratic National Convention to attack, on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s behalf, Donald Trump the Republican nominee for president. Their son, U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq in . Khizr Khan, in his speech to the DNC, lambasted Donald Trump for wanting to temporarily halt Islamic migration to America from countries with a proven history of exporting terrorists. Since then, Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos who served as a senior adviser to the president in Bill Clinton s White House and is a Clinton Foundation donor as well as a host on the ABC network pushed Trump on the matter in an interview. Trump s comments in that interview have sparked the same mini rebellion inside his party, in the media and across the aisle that has happened many times before. The usual suspects inside the GOP, from former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush to Sen. Lindsey Graham R SC to House Speaker Paul Ryan to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to Ohio Gov. John Kasich, have condemned Trump in one way or another. The media condemnation has been swift and Democrats, as well their friends throughout media, are driving the train as fast as they can. But until now, it looked like the Khans were just Gold Star parents who the big bad Donald Trump attacked. It turns out, however, in addition to being Gold Star parents, the Khans are financially and legally tied deeply to the industry of Muslim migration and to the government of Saudi Arabia and to the Clintons themselves. Khan, according to Intelius as also reported by Walid Shoebat, used to work at the law firm Hogan Lovells, LLP, a major D.C. law firm that has been on retainer as the law firm representing the government of Saudi Arabia in the United States for years. Citing federal government disclosure forms, the Washington Free Beacon reported the connection between Saudi Arabia and Hogan Lovells a couple weeks ago. Hogan Lovells LLP, another U.S. firm hired by the Saudis, is registered to work for the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia through , disclosures show, Joe Schoffstall of the Free Beacon reported. The federal form filed with the Department of Justice is a requirement under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of , which makes lobbyists and lawyers working on behalf of foreign governments and other agents from abroad with interests in the United States register with the federal government. The government of Saudi Arabia, of course, has donated heavily to the Clinton Foundation. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has given between and million to the foundation while Friends of Saudi Arabia has contributed between and million, Schoffstall wrote. Trump, of course, has called on Hillary Clinton to have the Clinton Foundation return the money. Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation want women as slaves and to kill gays, Trump wrote in a Facebook post back in June, according to Politico. Hillary must return all money from such countries! Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate, Trump posted in a separate Facebook posting at the time. I am calling on her to immediately return the million plus she got from them for the Clinton Foundation! Of course, to this day, Hillary Clinton and her Clinton Foundation has kept the money from the Saudi Arabian government. Schoffstall s piece in the Washington Free Beacon also notes how Hogan Lovells lobbyist Robert Kyle, per Federal Election Commission FEC records, has bundled more than , in donations for Clinton s campaign this year. Khan s connections with the Hogan Lovells firm run deep, according to a report from Law.com written by Katelyn Polantz. Many lawyers at Hogan Lovells remember the week in when U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan lost his life to a suicide bomber, Polantz wrote. Then Hogan Hartson attorneys mourned the death because the soldier s father, Khizr Khan, a Muslim American immigrant, was among their beloved colleagues. Polantz wrote that Khan worked at the mega D.C. law firm for years. Khan spent seven years, from to , in the Washington, D.C., office of then Hogan Hartson, Polantz wrote. He served as the firm s manager of litigation technology. Although he did not practice law while at Hogan, Khan was well versed in understanding the American courts system. On Thursday night, he described his late son dreaming of becoming a military lawyer. But representing the Clinton Foundation backing Saudi Arabian government and having one of its lobbyists bundle , plus for Clinton s campaign are hardly the only places where the Khan connected Hogan Lovells D.C. mega firm brush elbows with Clinton Cash. The firm also handles Hillary Clinton s taxes and is deeply connected with the email scandal whereby when she was Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton set up a home brew email server system that jeopardized classified information handling and was extremely careless according to FBI director James Comey. A lawyer at Hogan Hartson Howard Topaz has been Bill and Hillary Clinton s go to guy for tax advice since , according to documents released Friday by Hillary Clinton s campaign, The American Lawyer s Nate Raymond wrote in , as Hillary Clinton ran for president that year. The Clintons tax returns for show combined earnings of million, on which they paid million in taxes. New York based tax partner Howard Topaz has a broad tax practice, and also regularly advises corporations on M A and executive compensation. Breitbart News Patrick Howley, in a deep investigative piece on Hillary Clinton s email scandal, late last year uncovered how Topaz s firm which employed Khan while Topaz did Hillary Clinton s taxes is also connected to the email scandal. Topaz was a partner at Hogan Hartson, which later merged to become known as Hogan Lovells, where Topaz continues to practice. The firm s lawyers were major donors to Hillary Clinton s first presidential campaign, Howley wrote. For her private email system, Clinton used a spam filtering program MX Logic. Hogan Hartson handled the patent for MX Logic s email filtering program, which McAfee bought the small company for million in in order to acquire, Howley wrote. The MX Logic company s application for a trademark for its SPAMTRAQ program was filed in on Hogan Hartson stationery and signed by a Hogan Hartson attorney. Hogan Hartson has been responsible for MX Logic annual reports. The email company s Clinton links present more evidence that Clinton s political and legal establishment was monitoring her private email use. If that all isn t enough, that same Hogan Hartson law firm now Hogan Lovells employed Loretta Lynch, the current Attorney General of the United States. Lynch infamously just a few weeks ago met with Bill Clinton, Hillary s husband and the former president, on her private jet in Phoenix just before clearing Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing when it came to her illicit private email server system. Khan s own website for his own personal law firm KM Khan Law Office shows he represents clients in the business of buying visas to enter the United States. One of his specific areas of practice, according to the website, is E Treaty Investors, EB Investments Related Immigration Services. Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the U.S. Senate s Judiciary Committee, has detailed how the EB immigration program is riddled with flaws and corruption. Maybe it is only here on Capitol Hill on this island surrounded by reality that we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts, Grassley said in a statement earlier this year. The Government Accountability Office, the media, industry experts, members of congress, and federal agency officials, have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities. Allow me to mention a few of the flaws. From there, Sen. Grassley listed out several of the flaws with the EB immigration program that Khan works in Investments can be spent before business plans are approved. Regional Center operators can charge exorbitant fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments. Jobs created are not direct or verifiable jobs but rather are indirect and based on estimates and economic modeling. Jobs created by U.S. investors are counted by the foreign national when obtaining a green card, even if EB money is only a fraction of the total invested. Investment funds are not adequately vetted. Gifts and loans are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals. The investment level has been stagnant for nearly years. There s no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects. Regional centers can be rented or sold without government oversight or approval. Regional centers don t have to certify that they comply with securities laws. There s no oversight of promoters who work overseas for the regional centers. There s no set of sanctions for violations, no recourse for bad actors. There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center. Regional centers draw Targeted Employment Area boundaries around poor areas in order to come in at a lower investment level, yet the jobs created are not actually created in those areas. Every Targeted Employment Area designation is rubberstamped by the agency. Adjudicators are pressured to get to a yes, especially for those politically connected. Visas are not properly scrutinized. Visas are pushed through despite security warnings. Files and applications lack basic and necessary information to monitor compliance. The agency does not do site visits for each and every project. There s no transparency on how funds are spent, who is paid, and what investors are told about the projects they invest in. That s not to mention the fact that, according to Sen. Grassley, there have been serious national security violations in connection with the EB program that Khan works in and around already. In fact, the program according to Grassley was used by Middle Eastern operatives from Iran to attempt to illicitly enter the United States. There are also classified reports that detail the national security, fraud and abuse. Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story, Grassley said in the early February statement. The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program. One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States. The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance and money laundering. Maybe all of this is why as Breitbart News has previously noted the Democratic National Convention made absolutely no mention of the Clinton Foundation or Clinton Global Initiative. Hillary Clinton s coronation ceremony spent exactly zero minutes of the four nights of official DNC programming talking about anything to do with perhaps one of the biggest parts of her biography. ",

This is because the former President favored unprotected sex. And while the first tests came back negative, HIV and AIDS might explain an ongoing mystery.

This morning via Twitter as promised, Donald Trump spilled the beans about his opponent, Lyin Ted Cruz wife, Heidi. In a Skype interview with Donald Trump this morning, The Scooper was able to get some clarification in this new aspect of the Trump, Cruz feud. Lyin Ted Cruz is married to a former call girl. It s terrible. So terrible, stated the Donald. I mean, Lyin Ted Cruz thinks that Americans want a call girl in the White House? It s terrible. Just terrible, rambled Mr. Trump. When asked how he came to be in possession of this information, Mr. Trump responded, It s terrible. I didn t want to have to spill the beans. But I warned him Cruz not to go down this path. I warned him. It s terrible. He put out an attack ad about my wife. It s terrible, terrible. I warned him. But, he wants to play dirty. I know about a lot of skeletons in GOP closets. It s terrible. That is why the GOP is so very, very afraid of me. They know that I know, and they know that I will say what I know if I have to say what I know. You know? It s terrible. Just horrible. When asked why he thought this was terrible, the Scooper asked a follow up question. How do you know, and is your assertion that Heidi Cruz is a former call girl the truth? Well, I have been in the same room with her when she has committed these terrible, terrible acts. I have pictures! I have video! exclaimed The Donald. She is sitting there, dialing the phone. One poor person after another having to endure unsolicited calls from this girl. She wouldn t stop. She called, and called, and called. It s terrible. Horrible. And the things she says to these poor voters. Horrible. At this point, some woman with a lazy eye came into frame, screamed, and our connection went dead.",
