http://www.foxnews.com/	Arizona Diamondbacks star Zack Greinke made history Tuesday night against the San Diego Padres, becoming the first pitcher in two years to belt two home runs in a single game. Greinke got things done on the mound, too, coupling the long balls with a 10-strikeout performance in Arizona's 8-5 win over the Padres. He hit a three-run home run against Eric Lauer in the fourth inning and a solo home run against Adam Warren in the sixth inning. BRYCE HARPER RETURNS TO DC, RESPONDS TO BOOS WITH LONG H

The Institute for Supply Management’s nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index fell to 56.1 in March from 59.7 in February. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the index to fall to 58. The reading was the lowest since August 2017.
