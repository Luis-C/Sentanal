authoritarianism helps explain gop hard time co opting trump supporters even though supporters immediate policy concerns limiting immigration protecting national security line party orthodoxy real divide far go responding party establishment simply unwilling call explicitly authoritarian policies striking missing authoritarians concerns clear correlation authoritarianism support tax cuts people

commit extreme authoritarian action way trump problem party look tea party left republican establishment tea party delivered house gop ultimately left party unresolved civil war tea party candidates challenged moderates centrists leaving gop caucus divided chaotic similar divide playing presidential level results even destructive republican party authoritarians may slight majority within gop thus able force within party views unpopular win national election rise authoritarianism force within american politics means may de facto three party system democrats gop establishment gop authoritarians although latter two groups presently forced awkward coalition gop establishment demonstrated complete inability regain control renegade authoritarians authoritarians actively opposed establishment centrist goals uninterested economic platform time significant political consequences republican party become difficult republican candidates win presidency candidates win nomination appealing authoritarian primary voters struggle court mainstream voters general election less trouble local congressional elections might mean legislative gridlock gop caucus struggles balance demands authoritarian mainstream legislators authoritarian base drag party right social issues simultaneously erode support traditionally conservative economic policies meantime forces activating american authoritarians seem likely grow stronger norms around gender sexuality race continue evolving movements like black lives matter continue chipping away country legacy institutionalized discrimination pursuing kind social change reordering society authoritarians find threatening chaos middle east allows groups like isis flourish sends millions refugees spilling countries shows sign improving longer term current demographic trends continue white americans cease majority coming decades long run could mean gop even hard line immigration policing outspoken fearing muslims minority groups also takes softer line traditional party economic issues like tax cuts gop continues perform well congressional local elections whose divisions leave party caucus divided point barely functioning perhaps
