	{ "text": "A quick trip down memory lane causes a stumble over this gem from Obama He was gearing up for his first run at the office of President and was spewing lies all over the American public I ll make our government open and transparent so that anyone can ensure that our business is the people s business He is finally living up to that with less than a month left to his Presidency He is not bothering to hide the dirty business he conducts because he just doesn t care anymore Recent months aside everything that Obama pledged regarding transparency was smoke and mirrors Many are speculating that he will step up and stop talking about the Hillary email scandal and simply pardon her from any prosecution It is in his best interest to do so His attempts to marginalize the issue by nitpicking the statutory categories of confidential secret and top secret by commenting that there s classified and then there s classified were not successful He then took up the Clinton rhetoric of Russian spies Since emails from the President to the unsecure Clinton email were found it is likely that he will try and end the scandal while he still has the power to do so A reporter with first hand knowledge sums up Obama s transparent government Obama and his team criminalized reporting becoming the most secretive White House since Richard Nixon A message on the White House website from Obama makes it clear he still maintains the illusion that his office upheld the pledge of transparency My Administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in Government We will work together to ensure the public trust and establish a system of transparency public participation and collaboration Openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in Government Every action taken by Barack Hussein Obama was calculated He knew as did his advisors and supporters that he was actively engaged in deception against the United States David Axelrod was the Chief Strategist for both of Obama s campaigns He also served as Senior Adviser to the President until He was positioned to not only witness the secrecy that Obama demanded but he was also part of it After leaving the Obama administration Axelrod began to hint that things were quite different if we only looked below the surface Some of his revelations regarding Obama continue to come as a shock to people who the President painted with the colors of truth Obama lied about his support FOR same sex marriage before announcing his support for it in Yet if Obama s views were evolving publicly they were fully evolved behind closed doors Axelrod writes The president was champing at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed Obama chewed out Maureen Dowd on the campaign plane during the campaign No one got under Barack s skin more than Maureen He was patronizing and disrespectful This is a direct contradiction to the calm composed Obama that Axelrod had helped to portray He even lashed out at Axelrod Obama can have a short fuse though he hides it from the public The president called Axelrod a mother r and stalked out of a meeting after his strategist criticized the president s debating techniques as Obama prepared for his debate with Republican nominee Mitt Romney says Axelrod While those incidents speak to Obama s two faced behavior some of the secrecy of his administration can be summed up as simply lies Lie Obama has told the world there has never been a better friend of Israel in the White House Truth In September an Israeli newspaper reported that senior Obama Administration officials have told Tehran that Barack Obama does not intend to join Israel in any attack on Iran s nuclear installations Lie In May Obama said the fence between America and Mexico was basically complete Truth The Department of Homeland Security admits just miles or of the border is fenced Lie Obama lied and said abortions would not be publicly funded under Obamacare Truth A March edict from the Department of Health and Human Services HHS unequivocally ruled Obamacare will use our tax dollars to fund abortion Ben Rhodes was Obama s partner in crime when it comes to one of the biggest lies of the administration the Iran nuclear treaty Rhodes Obama s Deputy National Security Adviser openly admitted his contempt for journalists All these newspapers used to have foreign bureaus Now they don t They call us to explain to them what s happening in Moscow and Cairo Most of the outlets are reporting on world events from Washington The average reporter we talk to is years old and their only reporting experience consists of being around political campaigns That s a sea change They literally know nothing He later admitted more to David Samuels a writer profiling Rhodes for a New York Times Magazine cover story In the spring of last year legions of arms control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media and then became key sources for hundreds of often clueless reporters We created an echo chamber They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say Rhodes was obviously not ashamed to display his contempt Fast forward to the present day and the new level of corruption that Obama reached when dealing with journalist James Rosen In Risen published State of War The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration Unsurprisingly President Bush did not take kindly to the book and his administration turned the whole situation into an investigation of government whistleblowers Risen was subpoenaed to reveal his sources something he vehemently refused to do He speaks about the attempt by Presidents to try and spin these stories Well they have gone after investigative reporting They try to take essentially stories that they don t like and try to find some classified information that might be part of that and then turn it into a criminal leak investigation in which they say someone mishandled or disclosed classified information As you know you could do that with virtually any story in Washington Since then Risen has fought the Bush administration and then the Obama administration In Obama took a rather unprecedented step of renewing a subpoena scheduled to expire that year He was probably hoping nobody remembered that when in speech he told reporters Here in the United States of America police should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground In despite Risen keeping his sources confidential the federal government indicted Jeffrey A Sterling a former CIA operative with leaking the classified information to Risen He continued his defiance facing jail time when the government ordered him to appear as a witness at the trial of Sterling Finally in January of after years of uncertainty the government decided not to call Risen in the trial His fight for the truth had finally won Risen is a good example of how the Obama administration has fought the very ideas that he promised to uphold It is very likely that we will see more insiders coming forward to open up about Obama s years in the White House The truth would be a refreshing change A supporter of Risen Jerry Kammer a former Pulitzer Prize winning reporter who now works at the Center for Immigration Studies has this to say about President Obama He promised to be a different kind of president But he has only suppressed efforts to disclose the government s misdeeds His administration has been untransparent at so many levels ", "label": "neg"},

opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this about Donald Trump is

college buy a new car a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy Mikkleson said We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well but that s just ridiculous Do you know how much time that would take Instead we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours write a couple sentences and that s it I just want to be clear our website does zero journalism or anything creative and I m only telling you this for legal reasons For example do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax exempt status Did you actually read our story Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax What is the actual website URL We claim to know it but no real information is posted by us Mikkelson continues It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it In one recent story of ours we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar oh the hypocrisy but it is so funny at the same time We also like to post fake un funny juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is fabricated Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings they could probably make a lot of money Mikkelson laughs And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are proven false but since we block archive org it just becomes their word versus ours Plus I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts it results in more visitors Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for We don t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims It s just more of our hack unethical journalism and I only tell you this for legal reasons I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses but we never say what website it actually is I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism but people will click our ads regardless bottom line so why do the extra work To be honest I d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen

country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self satisfaction Self love is a silent killer in this country This needless act of hedonistic indulgence is leading our children

these deviants reform and become productive members of society That is why I believe a prison sentence of three to five years will help motivate these heathens to change their evil ways and stay off the Devil s playground for good Cruz said I m asking Mr Trump to acknowledge the severity of this problem and commit to finding real solutions If he does that I will do whatever it takes to help him

best answer there is I want an endorsement from Senator Cruz and I think I can go along with his request that makes pleasuring your genitalia for non reproductive purposes illegal This is not the first time that Cruz has attempted to use his political power to curtail the act of self stimulation As solicitor general of Texas in he fought to uphold the state s ban on sex toys by arguing that there was no Right to stimulate one s genitals Cruz eventually lost this battle but the story re surfaced this year and gained widespread media attention prompting Cruz s former college roommate Craig

of work and families living on the street Cruz is focused on making pleasuring yourself a crime Bradley continued Also I just want to say a big thank you to everyone that has supported our cause in giving new socks to the homeless it means so much Please donate what you can every bit helps Cruz however remains undeterred by his detractors When you play with your Devil stick or ring the Devil s doorbell you make the angels in heaven weep and they are weeping for this country hours a day days a week America needs strong moral leadership and I pray that Donald Trump is up to the task The fate of our great nation is in his hands hopefully they re big enough to handle it Most pundits expect Trump to answer Cruz s call and demand a stiffer approach to the matter A recent poll by the New York Times found that of likely Trump voters support a ban on self stimulation due to moral and religious concerns Another would be okay with a ban saying that they like Trump have far too many potential suitors and therefore do not need to satisfy their own urges Only of Trump supporters are against a ban RNC political strategist year old Paul Horner calls the move a no brainer and says that Trump would be foolish to turn his back on Cruz Conservatives are siding with Cruz overwhelmingly on this issue If Donald does not side with the Senator he risks alienating the party s Christian base and opening the door for a third party run by Cruz which would fracture the vote and all but guarantee a victory for Clinton Trump needs to agree with Cruz on this one no matter how creepy insane and absolutely horrible of a person he is David Mikkelson founder of Snopes com a website known for its biased opinions and inaccurate information they write about stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral and we spend a minute or two debunking it we make lots of money Stories like this have helped put my children through college buy a new car a home and even get the gender reassignment surgery my wife Barbara has always wanted since she was a little boy Mikkleson said We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well but that s just ridiculous Do you know how much time that would take Instead we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours write a couple sentences and that s it I just want to be clear our website does zero journalism or anything creative and I m only telling you this for legal reasons For example do you remember that recent article we wrote debunking a story which claimed Scientology lost its tax exempt status Did you actually read our story Who is the name of the person responsible for the hoax What is the actual website URL We claim to know it but no real information is posted by us Mikkelson continues It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it In one recent story of ours we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar oh the hypocrisy but it is so funny at the same time We also like to post fake un funny juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking but a simple google search that locates the actual article will show that our disclaimer is fabricated Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings they could probably make a lot of money Mikkelson laughs And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are proven false but since we block archive org it just becomes their word versus ours Plus I know for our writers like Kim LaCapria it is way more fun for them to cause controversy than report the facts it results in more visitors Kim LaCapria and Jeff Zarronandia go as far as accusing the site that the story originated from as a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories The thing that is troubling about these claims and what Snopes and our authors are known for We don t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up any of our claims It s just more of our hack unethical journalism and I only tell you this for legal reasons I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses but we never say what website it actually is I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism but people will click our ads regardless bottom line so why do the extra work To be honest I d say in a given week I probably only do about fifteen minutes of real actual work Regardless of which side Trump takes on the issue it is certain to invoke heated debate on both sides of the political aisle You can voice your opinion about Cruz s proposal by calling the Senator s Hour No Self Love Hotline at ", "label": "neg"},
	{ "text": "New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors working an alleged underage sexting case against former Congressman Anthony Weiner have turned over a newly found laptop he shared with wife Huma Abedin to the FBI with enough evidence to put Hillary Clinton and her crew away for life NYPD sources told True Pundit NYPD sources said Clinton s crew also included several unnamed yet implicated members of Congress in addition to her aides and insiders The NYPD seized the computer from Weiner during a search warrant and detectives discovered a trove of over emails to and from Hillary Clinton Abedin and other insiders during her tenure as secretary of state The content of those emails sparked the FBI to reopen its defunct email investigation into Clinton on Friday But new revelations on the contents of that laptop according to law enforcement sources implicate the Democratic presidential candidate her subordinates and even select elected officials in far more alleged serious crimes than mishandling classified and top secret emails sources said NYPD sources said these new emails include evidence linking Clinton herself and associates to Money laundering Child exploitation Sex crimes with minors children Perjury Pay to play through Clinton Foundation Obstruction of justice Other felony crimes NYPD detectives and a NYPD Chief the department s highest rank under Commissioner said openly that if the FBI and Justice Department fail to garner timely indictments against Clinton and co conspirators NYPD will go public with the damaging emails now in the hands of FBI Director James Comey and many FBI field offices What s in the emails is staggering and as a father it turned my stomach the NYPD Chief said There is not going to be any Houdini like escape from what we found We have copies of everything We will ship them to Wikileaks or I will personally hold my own press conference if it comes to that The NYPD Chief said once Comey saw the alarming contents of the emails he was forced to reopen a criminal probe against Clinton People are going to prison he said Meanwhile FBI sources said Abedin and Weiner were cooperating with federal agents who have taken over the non sexting portions the case from NYPD The husband and wife Clinton insiders are both shopping for separate immunity deals sources said If they don t cooperate they are going to see long sentences a federal law enforcement source said NYPD sources said Weiner or Abedin stored all the emails in a massive Microsoft Outlook program on the laptop The emails implicate other current and former members of Congress and one high ranking Democratic Senator as having possibly engaged in criminal activity too sources said Prosecutors in the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara have issued a subpoena for Weiner s cell phones and travel records law enforcement sources confirmed NYPD said it planned to order the same phone and travel records on Clinton and Abedin however the FBI said it was in the process of requesting the identical records Law enforcement sources are particularly interested in cell phone activity and travel to the Bahamas U S Virgin Islands and other locations that sources would not divulge The new emails contain travel documents and itineraries indicating Hillary Clinton President Bill Clinton Weiner and multiple members of Congress and other government officials accompanied convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on his Boeing on multiple occasions to his private island in the U S Virgin Islands sources said Epstein s island has also been dubbed Orgy Island or Sex Slave Island where Epstein allegedly pimps out underage girls and boys to international dignitaries Both NYPD and FBI sources confirm based on the new emails they now believe Hillary Clinton traveled as Epstein s guest on at least six occasions probably more when all the evidence is combed sources said Bill Clinton it has been confirmed in media reports spanning recent years that he too traveled with Epstein over times to the island Laptop Also Unveiled More Classified Top Secret Breaches According to other uncovered emails Abedin and Clinton both sent and received thousands of classified and top secret documents to personal email accounts including Weiner s unsecured campaign web site which is managed by Democratic political consultants in Washington D C Weiner maintained little known email accounts that the couple shared on the website anthonyweiner com Weiner a former seven term Democratic Congressman from New York primarily used that domain to campaign for Congress and for his failed mayoral bid of New York City At one point FBI sources said Abedin and Clinton s classified and top secret State Department documents and emails were stored in Weiner s email on a server shared with a dog grooming service and a western Canadian bicycle shop However Weiner and Abedin who is Hillary Clinton s closest personal aide weren t the only people with access to the Weiner s email account Potentially dozens of unknown individuals had access to Abedin s sensitive State Department emails that were stored in Weiner s email account FBI sources confirmed FEC records show Weiner paid more than of congressional campaign funds to Anne Lewis Strategies LLC to manage his email and web site According to FBI sources the D C based political consulting firm has served as the official administrator of the anthonyweiner com domain since the same time Abedin was working at the State Department This means technically Weiner and Abedin s emails including top secret State Department emails could have been accessed printed discussed leaked or distributed by untold numbers of personnel at the Anne Lewis consulting firm because they can control where the website and it emails are pointed FBI sources said According to FBI sources the bureau s newly minted probe into Clinton s use and handling of emails while she served as secretary of state has also been broadened to include investigating new email related revelations including Abedin forwarded classified and top secret State Department emails to Weiner s email Abedin stored emails containing government secrets in a special folder shared with Weiner warehousing over archived State Department emails Weiner had access to these classified and top secret documents without proper security clearance to view the records Abedin also used a personal yahoo address and her Clintonemail com address to send receive store classified and top secret documents A private consultant managed Weiner s site for the last six years including three years when Clinton was secretary of state and therefore had full access to all emails as the domain s listed registrant and administrator via Whois email contacts Because Weiner s campaign website is managed by the third party consultant and political email guru FBI agents are burdened with the task of trying to decipher just how many people had access to Weiner s server and emails and who were these people Or if the server was ever compromised by hackers or other actors Abedin told FBI agents in an April interview that she didn t know how to consistently print documents or emails from her secure Dept of State system Instead she would forward the sensitive emails to her yahoo Clintonemail com and her email linked to Weiner Abedin said according to FBI documents she would then access those email accounts via webmail from an unclassified computer system at the State Dept and print the documents many of which were classified and top secret from the largely unprotected webmail portals Clinton did not have a computer in her office on Mahogany Row at the State Dept so she was not able to read timely intelligence unless it was printed out for her Abedin said Abedin also said Clinton could not operate the secure State Dept fax machine installed in her Chappaqua NY home without assistance Perhaps more alarming according to the FBI s Report detailing its interview with Abedin none of the multiple FBI agents and Justice Department officials who conducted the interview pressed Abedin to further detail the email address linked to Weiner There was never a follow up according to the report But now all that has changed with the FBI s decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation and the husband and wife seeking immunity deals to testify against Clinton and other associates about the contents of the laptop s emails ", "label": "neg"},

	{ "text": " NaturalNews If a thug points a gun to your head hands you a piece of paper and says Sign this contract is the contract legally binding Of course it isn t It was coerced under the threat of violence and no court in the nation would uphold the contract as legally binding Yet right now electoral voters all across America are being essentially held at gunpoint threatened with being killed if they don t change their votes to oppose Donald Trump The dishonest mainstream media is further amplifying the coercion by running an organized psyop campaign of disinfo psyop means psychological operations which falsely claims the Russians hacked the election despite the complete absence of a shred of evidence to support the narrative The Russian hack conspiracy delusion has already been completely discredited It turns out the DNC emails were leaked by a democrat insider who supported Bernie Sanders The handing over of the emails took place in a wooded area in Washington D C and had nothing whatsoever to do with the Russians Electors around the country are being harassed with a barrage of emails phone calls and letters and even death threats in an effort to block Donald Trump from being voted in as president by the Electoral College on Monday reports the NY Post today The NY Post also reports Reports of GOP electors being badgered have been reported in numerous states including Georgia Idaho Tennessee Arizona Utah and Michigan For Michael Banerian a senior at Oakland University in Michigan and a Republican elector the harassment comes with a dark side He said he s been getting death threats via email snail mail Twitter and Facebook Somebody threatened to put a bullet in the back of my mouth Banerian told The Post on Wednesday Leftists are kidnapping electoral voters and holding them for ransom What you may not know is that these death threats are a coordinated campaign to threaten electoral voters into throwing the election Yet the very existence of such persistent coordinated death threats means that We the People must correct the electoral votes knowing that many such votes will be cast under the threat of being killed Thus electoral votes cast under threat or violence are not legally binding They may be reclaimed by the courts and corrected to represent the will of the voters in their states In essence the political left organized by international terrorist money man George Soros and people with ties to both the White House and Hillary Clinton has psychologically kidnapped the electoral voters and they re demanding a kind of ransom or they will be killed That ransom is a vote for anyone other than Donald Trump In other words this is a political mugging where the radical left is holding a gun to their heads and saying Your vote or your life And if they manage to switch electoral votes through such death threats the left will declare a victory for America proclaiming the very people they threatened with being killed as being heroes for saving the country Unbelievable isn t it This is right out of the Kim Jong Un playbook for how to run a brutal dictatorship which is probably why the radical left loves it so much If you do what they want you re heralded as a national hero If you don t do what they want you get a bullet in the head This really is the way liberals exert power by the way which is precisely why the DNC leaks happened in the first place Some Bernie Sanders supporters were so angry at the Clinton collusion and corruption they decided to expose the DNC by handing over leaked emails to Wikileaks The democrats only have themselves to blame for losing the election because the truth came out Lawless democrats have no respect for real democracy they re pushing America toward a civil war they will quickly lose What these tactics reveal is how lawless democrats have no respect whatsoever for the laws of this nation Acting as crybullies and domestic terrorists if they don t get their way they threaten to shoot everybody who disagrees with them Sound familiar Look up the history of China s Cultural Revolution That s the kind of behavior we see from totalitarian dictators in places like Cuba North Korea or Communist China And it s perfectly aligned with the tyrannical philosophy of the political left If they don t get their way they threaten to kill everyone who opposes them I ve got news for those who espouse such threats of violence coercion and lawlessness We the People will stop you by invoking the Second Amendment to protect the Republic And after we stop you we will imprison you and charge you with crimes of treason From there the courts can decide what punishment is appropriate for your crimes Once President Trump is sworn into office I hope he unleashes a massive investigation into all those who made death threats against the electoral voters Those individuals must be arrested imprisoned and charged with serious felony crimes including sedition Putting a gun to the heads of electoral voters is a very serious thing It threatens the sanctity of the entire Republic Such threats cannot go unpunished Hey we can finally put all those FEMA camps to good use In observing all this I ve come to realize the radical left is going to push America into a civil war But I also believe a civil war won t last very long because the left will be very quickly defeated by a combination of police military and armed American patriots fighting alongside law enforcement It turns out all those FEMA camps will come in handy after all That s where we can put all the left wing terrorists and traitors who tried but failed to overthrow the country There we ll pump in broadcasts of Sean Hannity and Michael Savage until we break the NLP hypnosis programming the left wingers have been subjected to for the last eight years under Obama a master of linguistic subterfuge Over time some of them might be rehabilitated to the point where they can rejoin society as sane rational citizens instead of the mentally ill crybullies they are today After all we want to help these people heal their mental illness wherever possible Unlike the radical left which wants to kill everyone they don t agree with conservative Americans are far more interested in saving lives and uplifting our fellow brothers and sisters no matter what sort of psychological trauma they were subjected to by CNN the Washington Post and the New York Times Remember The same kind of psyop the media is running right now against the electoral voters has been pursued for years against liberals and progressives That s why they are so traumatized by reality They ve been poisoned programmed hypnotized and traumatized by the left wing media for as long as they

	{ "text": "U S Agency for International Development s USAID worked in Afghanistan from July through June under the Obama administration The work there included supporting Afghan health facilities They spend nearly million through the Partnership Contracts for Health Program The logic seems sounds in a country at war we can help by providing health care Unfortunately it seems that USAID is not accomplishing their tasks On the website the USAID claims that during the current administration The Agency began rebuilding with an eye to getting the most bang out of its funding allocations This must be code for We will take millions to build hospitals and lose them because this is exactly what the group has done Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction SIGAR John Sopko wrote to the agency stating One Afghanistan hospital funded by the U S Agency for International Development was located more than miles away from the listed coordinates while another facilities were more than six miles away The letter elaborated SIGAR sought to conduct site inspections at of facilities in Badakhshan an Afghan province but was unable to locate one facility SIGAR found substantial inaccuracies in the geospatial coordinates USAID previously provided for many of these health facilities and observed that not all facilities had access to electricity and drinking water The money to help is going somewhere else Sopko went on to say that only of the inspected facilities were located near the coordinates USAID provided This means that only about of the hospitals were in the places they were supposed to be In some cases the coordinates given were not even in the correct country coordinates for of the facilities were not located in the districts listed in the most recent information available to USAID Coordinates for two health facilities were located in Pakistan Afghanistan s neighboring country to the southeast One health facility was actually listed as being in the Mediterranean Sea by USAID Others were miles from the reported coordinates four were more than six miles away from their listed coordinates and another three were between three and six miles away Another six facilities were between just over a half mile and three miles away while nine were actually located within about a half mile of their listed location It seems as though this has been an ongoing problem for USAID As SIGAR has stressed previously robust program oversight requires specific knowledge of the location where the service is provided Sopko wrote to USAID Administrator Gayle Smith A USAID official reported that it would not bother correcting the problem The agency no longer maintains location data and obtaining it would require a specialized request to the Afghan government which USAID was unwilling to make Sopko countered this statement USAID s position regarding its monitoring responsibilities is troubling W e encourage USAID to request and maintain this information in order to help ensure that funding spent to improve the health of specific populations is actually reaching the intended communities It would seem necessary for someone to step in and stop the funding to this program until it starts reporting correctly Sopko emphasized the importance of this when he stated Maintaining accurate GPS data would help the USAID conduct site visits and help ensure that the intended communities receive needed health services Instead of taking a closer look at what is really happening the agency will go on funding health centers providing another million for the facilities In turn the United States will keep funding USAID The bizarre circle of corruption will continue USAID has clearly stated their intentions going forward USAID does not intend to maintain coordinates They will instead rely on the World Bank and the Afghan government who are now handling the facilities Given this set of facts the U S needs to withdraw its funding of the agency Obama and liberals shown no signs that this will happen though The facilities that SIGAR Sopko was able to inspect were in poor condition W e did observe some basic structural concerns at most of the facilities such as cracked walls leaking roofs broken doors and shattered windows which indicate clear concerns with sanitation and safety Inspectors also found exposed wiring Electrical deficiencies such as exposed live wires pose serious hazards that could endanger the safety of patients and staff Horrible conditions This brings a chilling image of what kind of care the patients might be receiving Liberals are not concerned that millions are disappearing into a bottomless pit Millions have gone to fund clinics that are either misplaced or in such disrepair that they should be closed Millions more will be given before this funding runs out Why is nobody in Washington asking questions The answers will leave the White House with Obama His dirty hands are all over this one as he stands in front of the American public and claims he is concerned that the government is helping innocent citizens in the war torn country of Afghanistan As usual this is all lies A more likely scenario given what we know now is that he needed a reason to funnel money into the country and the facade of health clinics was believable at the time No more money should be sent to any program that

since been revealed as a pathological liar and as a racist white hating Muslim agitator but he was operating under a much more stealthy strategy which was moderately effective at masking his destructive goals at the time WikiLeaks has since made some things much clearer There were those who knew what he was up to but their silence had been purchased One such individual was Preeta Bansal who may or may not share Obama s personal characteristics and goals but certainly did nothing to expose his She was one of the first of innumerable foreigners to be given high positions within the Obama regime being a naturalized Indian Obama has frequently used those with the weakest of ties to traditional America as his agents of fundamental transformation and anti white anti American prejudice bansal obama discrimination As the WikiLeaks leaked Podesta email reveals Bansal was engaged not only in racist employment discrimination but religious discrimination against Christians in the recommendation and review process for potential new hires within the executive branch That s the kind of thing that Loretta Lynch and her bulldog DOJ Civil Rights Deputy Vanita Gupta would be all over if it were to happen to a Muslim or non white Discriminating against whites and Christians is just who we are under this racist America hating Islamist One thing that is important to remember is that this compilation of Muslim and Asian candidates for preferential employment treatment would not have been prepared without it being specifically requested by the inner circle within the Obama administration Race based preference was to be given and discrimination against those who were not Muslim or Asian was to be engaged in Being Arab alone wasn t enough to get you onto the good list Bansal specifically states that Arab Americans who were not Muslims were not included She also acknowledges that she included high profile Muslims even though she believed they would not survive the vetting process due to the attention they would receive from bloggers Two questions rise from that admission what kind of people is she seeking that blogger revelations would sink their candidacy and why did she knowing their background difficulties still include them as potential recruits The WikiLeaks Podesta email from October of forwarded to John Podesta which contains the Bansal

Monday September PM To Froman Michael B Cc Onek Matthew Subject Asian American Candidates Muslim American Candidates Here are the compiled lists of Asian American and Muslim American candidates for top Administration jobs sub cabinet jobs and outside boards agencies policy committees A couple things to note about the list of Muslim American candidates In the candidates for top jobs I excluded those with some Arab American background but who are not Muslim e g George Mitchell Many Lebanese Americans for example are Christian In the last list of outside boards commissions most who are listed appear to be Muslim American except that a handful where noted may be Arab American but of uncertain religion esp Christian There is only one candidate I thought was a viable one for a Secretary level job among the Muslim Americans That said on both lists there are some very senior people listed in the last category for outside boards commissions who conceivably could be considered for top jobs The very senior people I put on the last list tended not to be terribly involved in politics or policy or in the case of some Asian Americans had already served in the Clinton and even Carter Administrations and so I thought we should seek new talent But there s no magic to some of the placements I think the lists are fairly exhaustive but some of the people may be moved to other categories High profile Muslim Americans tend to be the subject of a fair amount of blogger criticism and so the individuals on this list would need to be ESPECIALLY carefully vetted I suspect some of the people I list would not survive such a vet but I do personally know at least in part virtually all of the candidates in the st two categories but I know very few of those listed for outside boards

recite or encourage others to recite the pledge while on duty This law also applies to federal contractors and other institutions that receive federal funding such as public schools Individuals who violate this order can face fines of up to and up to one year in federal prison During the press conference the President explained his decision was based on a personal belief that the language used in the pledge is divisive and contrary to America s deepest held values The pledge excludes so many Americans who are vital to making this country what it is Obama said Asking someone to pledge their allegiance to our country excludes Jehovah s Witnesses Amish Muslims and many others whose religious beliefs prohibit strong displays of nationalism By calling this one nation under God we exclude the millions of hard working atheists and agnostics who call America home By saying liberty and justice for all we ignore the grievances of millions of Hispanics African Americans and Muslims who feel they have neither liberty nor justice Obama told reporters that he believes the inclusion of under God runs afoul of the First Amendment s establishment clause He summed up his press briefing by challenging congress to create a new pledge that more accurately reflects America s values I am willing to rescind my decision here today and allow the Pledge of Allegiance back into the schools if we can all agree on the creation of a new Pledge something that is includes everyone s beliefs and not just the belief of one nationality or faith Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has already offered her support of president Obama s decree and has vowed to uphold the order if she wins in November s general election She echoed his concerns about the pledge s language and suggested

out there the best there is greater than all the other children in this world combined Obama who founded ISIS by the way wants them not to be great he wants them to be weak and by banning the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools he has proven that here today This is the first step in many in his master plan to force Sharia law onto this great country of ours before he leaves office in January We

the Secular Coalition for America told reporters that Obama s decision to ban the Pledge is a victory for all those who oppose government control When our children are forced to chant One nation under God whose God are they referring to exactly Ketchum said From birth children are indoctrinated and subjected to mind control efforts to shape them into the perfect beings that society wants them to be The Pledge of Allegiance is just one of the many tools used in a child s involuntary reeducation of basic beliefs and values Ketchum continued This is a great day not just for Atheists but for all Americans who value freedom Forcing children to pledge blind allegiance to this country and profess a belief in a God is extremely dangerous in developing young minds and amounts to little more than government mind control While Executive Order is likely to be a source of heated debate among Americans constitutional scholar Paul Horner told ABC News that it is unlikely the law will be challenged

in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing You have to understand that when a story like this goes viral and we spend a minute or two debunking it we make lots of money Stories like this have helped put my children through college buy a new car a home and even get the sex reassignment surgery my wife Barbara always wanted since she was a little boy Mikkleson said We claim to provide evidence for such debunkings and confirmation as well but that s just ridiculous Do you know how much time that would take Instead we just copy and paste parts of the original article into ours write a couple sentences and that s it I just want to be clear our website does zero journalism or anything creative and I m only telling you this for legal reasons Mikkleson continues A typical story of ours makes wild claims using grammatical errors misspellings and words like umimumimaginative recycled hoax saying that a story illegally appropriates the trademarks of legitimate news organizations but we list no links or sources of information they are all just outrageous accusations by us And that story will get shares or more on Facebook that s a lot of ad revenue for only writing a couple sentences Mikkelson further explains It is common for us to rewrite a story we re debunking if we don t like it In one recent story of ours we actually removed a person s name from the original article and then called him a liar it s so funny We also like to post fake un funny juvenile disclaimers supposedly from the site in question and it is our authors such as Jeff Zarronandia who are responsible for those gems We tell our readers that the disclaimer is from the story we are debunking but a simple google search will show that our disclaimer is fabricated Sometimes I think that someone should start a company that debunks our debunkings they could probably make a lot of money Mikkelson laughs And lots of people complain about our authors attacking websites and their owners for reasons that are proven false but since we block archive org it just becomes their word versus ours Our writers like Zarronandia go as far as to say that the story originated from a clickbait fake news site that infringes the trademark protected visual elements and domain names of legitimate news outlets in order to generate traffic and drive advertising revenues by creating and spreading entirely false news stories But we don t list ONE factual piece of evidence to back up our claims It s just more of our hack unethical journalism and as I said before I only tell you this for legal reasons I think it is business as usual for us to accuse the story we are debunking of spreading malware and viruses but we never say what website it actually is I think warning people about a site that could potentially destroy their computer is probably a good idea and I hope one day to do that kind of ethical journalism but people will click

in the anthem is violent and hostile to African Americans If the recent protests by athletes like San Francisco ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick have taught us anything it s that the anthem is far too violent and far too polarizing to have any place in the national discourse Our nation is being torn apart by a song a song that is outdated and jingoistic Without swift action we cannot move forward

said that he would consider rescinding the order if Congress can come up with a politically correct version that more accurately reflects our changing values as a nation The days of the United States being a domineering world power that seeks to police the entire world through military force are coming to an end Obama said We need an anthem that reflects the nation we are becoming not the nation

country that oppresses black people and people of color In a relatively short period of time his protest of police brutality and racial injustice in the United States has captivated the country and

speaking to an estimated crowd of over cheering fans and supporters Hello South Carolina Are you ready to get weird or what Murray said to the roaring crowd Murray s speech which lasted a little more than an hour touched on many issues from his campaign including increased wages health care the cost of higher education and human rights in general The rally also included wine tasting and stages where the people in attendance were allowed to sing karaoke I saw the Republican debate the other night and it made me sick to my stomach Murray told the crowd Here are grown men candidates running for President of the United States and they re acting like year olds They re up there on stage broadcasted to the entire world calling each other names interrupting each other making complete fools of themselves and I just thought to myself I think the American people deserve better than this I know we deserve better than this because we are better than this Political analyst Paul Horner told ABC News he has taken an extreme interest in what Murray is doing since he announced his run for President just a little more than a week ago I don t know if Bill Murray is really running for President or if he s just having some fun but the man is making some excellent points out there He s getting people to think about the state their country is in right now and making a lot of people happy while doing it I applaud Mr Murray for what he s doing I pretty much don t like any of the candidates that are running for President right now Murray told the crowd I think Bernie Sanders seems like a decent guy but the rest of em are pretty much complete pond scum in my opinion Murray continued I m always traveling around the world but I m proud to call America the good ole U S of A my home I think there s a lot of great people here a lot of potential but there s also a lot of confusion and hate right now People don t know what to make of these Hitler wanna be s like Donald Trump and the Ted Cruz s who want to start World War III They feed on the hate and paranoia a lot of this country has and because of that you see them leading in the polls And it s sad that people go along with it and can t see it for what it really is Sarah Bradley a spokeswoman for Sock It Forward a group that provides the homeless and those less fortunate with brand new socks told ABC News that she fully supports Murray and his run for President We need a new face in Washington Someone who has no political ties or agenda and can t be bought Bradley said I actually met Bill Murray a while back when we were starting our cause that gives new socks to the homeless Bill made a donation right there on the spot saying what we were doing was amazing he s such a great guy He truly cares about people and making the world a better place Murray finished the rally by saying I m no hero I just want to help out and I hope you all choose to stand behind me or beside me or wherever is comfortable for you but just as long as it s with me Look we don t need to make America great again because it already is we all just need to try a little bit harder and have more love in our hearts for our fellow man I think if you can take care of yourself and then maybe take care of someone else then that s sort of how you re supposed to live Lets all help each other make this the best life experience possible Murray still has yet to announce if he will be running as an Republican Democrat or Independent David Mikkelson founder of Snopes a website that takes the fun out of stories on the internet in order to generate advertising revenue told ABC News that he approves of what a story like this is accomplishing This type of story when it goes viral and we debunk it we make money Mikkelson said The secret behind a good Snopes article is a formula that we have used since day one it s actually quite simple First we start with the same cookie cutter outline we use for every site that we debunk Next we copy and paste parts of the original article into ours After that one of our writers will type one or two sentences that talk about the content we just copy and pasted And now last but not least we slap a title on there similar to the article s headline that we re debunking This way it will show up at the top of Google for anyone searching for that story and that s it Then we just sit back and let the money roll in We are the absolute definition of clickbait I ll tell what if it wasn t for great writers like Internet news satirist Paul Horner putting out the stories that he does my children wouldn t have been able to go to college Holding back tears Mikkelson finishes by saying Though we are currently being sued by Fox News for calling them a fake news site so lets just hope Paul Horner writes another story soon Murray s campaign team told reporters their next stop is the Arizona State Capitol on March nd and then the Tempe Improv later that night It is rumored Murray will be at the Improv meeting with locals and telling a few jokes Tickets to that show are only ", "label": "neg"},

It was one of m files given to the Germany newspaper S ddeutsche Zeitung by an anonymous source The registry is public but details of individual directors are typically incomplete or missing entirely Though there is nothing untoward about this directorship it has not been reported before and is likely to raise fresh questions over Tillerson s relationship with Russia ahead of a potentially stormy confirmation hearing by the US senate foreign relations committee Exxon said on Sunday that Tillerson was no longer a director after becoming the company s CEO in ExxonMobil s use of offshore regimes

company Rosneft and the de facto second most powerful figure inside the Kremlin A hardliner Sechin is ex KGB Tillerson s award followed a deal between ExxonMobil and Rosneft to explore the Kara Sea in Russia s Arctic It was put on hold in after the Obama administration imposed wide ranging sanctions against Russia The sanctions were punishment for Putin s Crimea annexation that spring and Russia s undercover invasion of eastern Ukraine The ban covers the US sharing of sophisticated offshore and shale oil technology Exxon was supposed to halt its drilling with Rosneft The firm successfully pleaded with the US Treasury department to delay the ban by a few weeks with the Kremlin threatening to seize its rig In this brief window Exxon discovered a major Arctic field with some m barrels of new oil Tillerson has criticised the US government s policy on Russia In he told Exxon s annual meeting that we do not support sanctions He added We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who they are really harming It is widely assumed by investors that the new Trump administration will drop sanctions This would allow the Kara

serious concerns about giving Tillerson the job Rubio praised him as a respected businessman but said that the next secretary of state must be someone who views the world with moral clarity and who has a clear sense of America s interests Tillerson is likely to get rid of his Exxon stock if the narrowly Republican majority Senate confirms his appointment Controversy over his links with Russia

prior experience running a federal agency That marks a significant change from past presidential administrations which were well stocked with more experienced political hands Mr Trump s Cabinet is a mix of rich businessmen former military leaders and conservative true believers He may have campaigned as an anti establishment outsider but he s mostly surrounding himself with powerful wealthy influential men While many may be outsiders to the game of elective politics they re not exactly drawn from the ranks of the angry populist masses Here s a closer look at how it all shakes out You can follow Anthony on Twitter awzurcher Captains of industry ExxonMobil head Rex Tillerson sits at a shareholder meeting in Dallas Image copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption Rex Tillerson hopes to move from the ExxonMobil boardroom to White House Cabinet meetings American voters elected a businessman with no political experience as their president and he s filled many of his top administration jobs with businessmen who have no political experience Leading the way are Rex Tillerson who has helmed the international energy conglomerate ExxonMobil since as secretary of state and venture capitalist and former Goldman Sachs executive Steven Mnuchin for Treasury Other notable picks include the so called king of bankruptcy Wilbur Ross for commerce and fast food mogul Andrew Puzder at Labor What we ve learned Mr Trump campaigned against a global elite that he said was stripping the working class of its wealth By looking to Wall Street insiders and corporate chieftains for key administration spots however his post election actions signal a decidedly different mentality Read more about Rex Tillerson wildcard diplomat Steven Mnuchin Secretary of the Treasury nominee Andrew Puzder Secretary of Labor Here come the generals At one point during the campaign Mr Trump quipped that he knew more about fighting the so called Islamic State than many of the generals currently running US military operations When it came time to fill out his national security apparatus however the president elect has frequently turned to the military brass General James Mattis testifies before CongressImage copyrightGETTY IMAGES Image caption James Mattis is a former general that Donald Trump likes James Mattis defence and John Kelly homeland security are both retired generals as is Michael Flynn who Mr Trump has slated for national security adviser a position that does not require Senate confirmation Taken individually the picks are unremarkable ex military leaders sometimes wind up in the presidential administrations of both Democrats and Republicans Colin Powell was George W Bush s secretary of state and David Petraeus ran the Central Intelligence Agency under Barack Obama Together however Mr Trump s picks give his administration a decidedly martial bent While he may have mocked Mr Obama s generals Mr Trump who attended military school as a youth seems inclined to favour the spit and polish of military leadership The military is one of the few institutions still viewed favourably by the American public and Mr Trump seems more than happy to march along with it What we ve

President George W Bush and is married to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley considered a party rising star is the nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations Given that Mr Trump is likely to be a hands off president when it comes to the day to day management of his administration department heads will wield considerable power over the next four years While the president elect has said there are portions of Barack Obama s healthcare reform that he likes for instance chances are Mr Price will use his health secretary authority to strip the programme of much of its power While he may sit down with former Vice President Al Gore to talk climate change his Environmental Protection Agency nominee Scott Pruitt is an outspoken critic and legal

Washington actively helped craft last week s U N resolution declaring Israeli settlements illegal The allegations further poisoned the increasingly toxic atmosphere between Israel and the outgoing

on the momentum from the Security Council vote The U N vote s impact on U S Israel relations Play VIDEO The U N vote s impact on U S Israel relations Although the U S has long opposed Israeli settlements on occupied lands it has traditionally used its veto in the U N Security Council to protect its ally Israel from international censure But in a change of policy it abstained from Friday s vote allowing the resolution to pass by a margin Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who has long had a cool relationship with President Barack Obama has called the resolution shameful and accused the U S of playing a leading role in its passage On Tuesday his spokesman went even further We have ironclad information that emanates from sources in the Arab world and that shows the Obama administration helped craft this resolution and pushed hard for its eventual passage David Keyes said We re not just going to be a punching bag and go quietly into the night as the Obama administration helps push such a grave resolution he said How U N resolution against Israel will impact U S relations Play VIDEO How U N resolution against Israel will impact U S relations He did not identify the Arab sources or say how Israel obtained the information Israel has close security ties with Egypt an original sponsor of last week s resolution Under heavy Israeli pressure Egypt delayed the resolution last week before other council members presented it for a vote a day later Egypt ended up voting in favor of the measure Keyes claim mirrors that of his boss Netanyahu who told his Cabinet on Sunday From the information that we have we have no doubt that the Obama Administration initiated it stood behind it coordinated on the wording and demanded that it be passed Netanyahu insists that there is nothing wrong with his controversial policy of building Jewish towns in occupied areas that the Palestinians with overwhelming world support claim for their state U S Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power defended the U S abstention saying We would not have let this resolution pass if it hadn t addressed counterproductive steps by the Palestinians And she added that the vote does not in any way diminish the United States steadfast and unparalleled commitment to the security of Israel Power also warned that settlements make it harder to negotiate a separate Palestinian state which the administration believes is crucial to a lasting peace CBS News Margaret Brennan reports The United States has been sending a message that the settlements must stop privately and publicly for nearly five decades Power said Israel s recent diplomatic defeat would be much more damaging if not for a potential remaining and rather major ace in Netanyahu s hand the incoming Trump Administration In a striking departure from past policy of incumbent presidents waiting on the sidelines Trump tried to scuttle the resolution and called for a U S veto After the vote Trump vowed that things will be different after Jan th Critically he has appointed an outspoken supporter and donor to the settlements his longtime attorney David Friedman as ambassador to Israel And aides say Trump is serious about a promise to move the U S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem which even many Israelis fear could spark violence The Palestinians claim east Jerusalem home to sensitive religious sites as the capital of the future state to which they aspire After Friday s vote Netanyahu s office said he looked forward to working with Trump to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution It remains unclear what Trump might be able to do While he will be able to wield the U S veto to prevent further action against Israel in the council mustering enough votes to overturn Friday s decision appears to be impossible The basis for the resolution is found in the Geneva conventions which forbid the settling of areas captured in war from another country Israel has said the law doesn t apply because the territory was captured from Jordan which has renounced all claims to the land Israel has also defended the occupation on religious and security grounds When Netanyahu s rivals in Israel oppose the settlements it is not necessarily due to a conviction that could be peace could be at hand but rather for concern for Israel s democracy If Israel becomes inseparable from the West Bank it will have to grant its million Palestinians voting rights or increasingly be unable to call itself a democracy The country is toxically divided on the issue and key sectors of society including intellectual elites and much of its security establishment want to see settlements end Many of them welcome some openly and many more quietly any world pressure to bring that about Dan Miodownik a professor of political science and international relations at Hebrew University said there were actually some positive elements for Israel in the resolution He said it endorsed the idea of territorial swaps meaning that Israel could keep some settlements as part of a negotiated peace deal And the differentiation between Israel proper and the settlements signaled that unlike in the past Israel was

factions together won t be easy Some Republicans would revise and rebrand Obamacare junking unpopular provisions like its requirement that most Americans carry health insurance while preserving well liked parts Others would rip up the Affordable Care Act or ACA and not replace it Can Congress put aside differences in the new year Play VIDEO Can Congress put aside differences in the new year President elect Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders will have to unite the groups on complicated changes affecting the financial and physical well being of millions of people For some constituents in fragile health it s literally a life and death debate Republicans have a really narrow path says Grace Marie Turner of the Galen Institute a free market health care research organization They ve got to deal with the politics of this they ve got to make sure they come up with good policy and they also have process challenges Success is not guaranteed and Republicans may come to regret that their party defined itself as totally opposed to Obamacare Yet House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady seems unfazed by the challenge It s like tax reform says Brady a Texas Republican explaining that many pieces will be pulled together Unlike Obamacare which ripped up the individual market this will be done deliberately in an appropriate timetable Republicans say they will move quickly to repeal the ACA while suspending the effective date to allow them to craft a replacement Here s a look at the GOP camps and who s in them Revise and rebrand Many Republicans may quietly be in this contingent but fear being accused of promoting Obamacare lite They d strip out some of the ACA s taxes and requirements The unpopular individual mandate to carry health insurance or risk fines could be replaced with other persuasion short of a government dictate Rules on insurers would be loosened But popular provisions such as protecting those with pre existing health conditions would be retained in some form as well as financial assistance for low and moderate income people The requirement that health plans cover adult children until age would be fairly easy to preserve since employers have accommodated it A rebranded version of Obama s law may well cover fewer people But its GOP advocates believe most Americans will find their goal of universal access to care politically acceptable when measured against the Democratic ideal of universal coverage underwritten by government Many GOP allies in the business community favor revising the ACA That includes major players among hospitals insurers and pharmaceuticals Trump may have given this group some cover by saying that he wants to keep parts of the law but his bottom line remains unknown Budget hawks For budget hawks unwinding the Obama health law is a beginning Next they could move on to much bigger objectives like restructuring Medicaid and Medicare and placing a cost conscious limit on tax breaks for employer coverage Budget hawks see health care as the main driver of government deficits and they are loath to address that imbalance by raising taxes Instead they want to rewrite the social compact so individuals accept more responsibility and risk for their health care House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is the most prominent member of this camp and his Better Way agenda is its roadmap Georgia Rep Tom Price Trump s nominee for Health and Human Services is a budget hawk Vice President elect Mike Pence has been in the same orbit throughout his career The problem for budget hawks is that the political campaign did not give them a mandate Issues like Medicare and Medicaid were scarcely discussed Trump said he wouldn t cut Medicare and sent conflicting signals on Medicaid Many Democrats can t wait for Republicans to follow the call of the budget hawks Betting that will backfire House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is rallying her lawmakers against attacks on the ACA and Medicare The rip it up society The most conservative lawmakers want to pull Obamacare up by the roots as if it never existed says Republican political consultant Frank Luntz That sentiment is embodied by the or so members of the House Freedom Caucus and it s probably broadly shared among conservatives Some do not believe the federal government should be involved in health care and they couldn t care less about replacing the ACA They would say that Obama s plan has failed said Luntz GOP leaders may need these lawmakers to advance on replacement legislation coaxing them to a middle ground might not be possible Trump calls the ACA a disaster and that s pleasing to those farthest on the right It s unclear if he d walk their walk Pragmatists At the core of this small group are legislative veterans who understand the excruciating difficulties of getting major bills to a president s desk GOP Sens Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Susan Collins of Maine are pragmatists They may find support from Republican governors who expanded Medicaid under the health law GOP congressional leaders could gravitate to this camp The biggest challenge for pragmatists will be to win over some Democrats for replacement legislation While repealing most of Obamacare is possible with a simple majority in the Senate votes would probably be needed for a replacement There will only be GOP senators next year Republicans need a fancy Rose Garden repeal ceremony and I expect them to have one said Dan Mendelson CEO of the consulting firm Avalere Health On the other hand there s million people with health insurance under the ACA and they don t want to dump them There s no clear path for how to square that conflict ", "label": "pos"},

to be overstated According to the Washington Post s David Fahrenthold who has researched the foundation s donations and expenses for several months Trump and his companies have given about million to the charity since its launch according to tax records up to However the president elect has not given anything to the foundation from until his businesses gave to the foundation in for the first time in several years according to the Post In fact the two largest donors were professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon who gave million to the foundation from until Trump has nominated Linda McMahon to lead the Small Business Administration And as Fahrenthold reported during the campaign not all of the money was solely for charitable purposes In many cases spending benefited Trump

philanthropy in other ways But Trump cannot shutter the foundation just yet since it s under investigation by the New York attorney general according to the office s spokeswoman Amy Spitalnick

Clintons set up a business to profit from public office Trump said at an August rally in Texas They sold access and specific actions by and really for I guess the making of large amounts of money Those claims have not been borne out by evidence In August the Clintons vowed to drastically reduce the size of their foundation to avoid appearances of conflict They denied any insinuation of pay to play and defended the work of the Clinton Foundation At the time RNC chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement If everything was above board while Hillary Clinton ran the State Department as the Clintons have said then why change a thing But now it s Trump and his family who have come under fire for some of the same alleged behaviors An AP investigation found that Trump s son Eric has

echo of an earlier request for the Energy Department to list employees who work on climate change In a brief email that was sent Wednesday morning the Trump team asked the State Department s bureaus and offices to list any programs or activities that promote gender equality such as ending gender based violence promoting women s participation in economic and political spheres entrepreneurship etc The email was acquired and published by The New York Times which reports Although the wording of the memo is neutral and does not hint at any policy change it rattled State Department employees even those at senior levels Some officials said they feared that the incoming Trump administration was trying to determine what programs were focused on lesbian gay bisexual and transgender issues though the memo did not refer to them The team also asked the department offices to note positions whose primary functions are to promote such issues and to highlight any funds for the current financial year that are already allocated to such programs and activities Affirming the Times characterization of the email s reception The Los Angeles Times quotes a senior State Department official who said People are freaked out Update a m ET Friday Trump Team s Response In a statement about the request the Trump transition team says President elect Trump will ensure the rights of women across the world are valued and protected To help fulfill this promise the transition team inquired about existing programs at the State department that helps foster gender equality ends gender based violence and promotes economic and political participation finding ways to improve them along with hundreds of other requests Our original post continues The topic also came up at Thursday s daily State Department briefing but NPR s Michele Kelemen says it seemed that spokesman John Kirby mainly sought to calm nerves about the request In a report for our Newscast unit Michele quotes Kirby as saying To the degree that there is interest in the way that we have approached pursuing gender equality and human rights around the world by the transition team we will certainly provide them the context the information that is appropriate for them to make their own decisions going forward Kirby acknowledged that there could be anxiety at a time of transition but he refused to go into details about the email or to verify the accuracy of the leaked documents Addressing his agency s approach to gender issues Kirby told a reporter Obviously gender equality issues here at the Department of State are a priority Secretary Kerry has made them a priority Secretary Clinton before him made it a priority and it remains one for us here Kirby also suggested that the State Department might balk at naming its employees who have worked on those priorities saying that in a hypothetical case if there were issue specific names requested obviously that would be of concern to us and it would not be the kind of information that we would deem to be appropriate to be passed along Shortly after the transition team s email became public the Twitter account of the State Department s Political Military Affairs bureau posted a note of support for the National Action Plan on Women Peace Security a program that was celebrated in a State Department tweet Wednesday as the agency marked five years since the plan was introduced by

place to build her academic career over a decade is suddenly seeing her job security and research prospects up in the air I m worried that after my current contract finishes one of the prerequisites could be a permanent residence card she said I d like to apply for EU grant money but how much longer will it be available for Britain s top universities have long been among the world s most sought after destinations for study and research drawing the brightest minds from all corners of the globe But since Britons voted in June to leave the nation EU many in the science community say the U K risks losing the money the international influence and crucially the talent to sustain that enviable position More than one tenth of research funding at British universities has come from the EU in recent years Some fields such as nanotechnology and cancer research are more dependent on EU funding than others according to a report by technology firm Digital Science From to Britain received billion euros billion in direct EU investment in research Bagniewska is not just anxious about herself she s upset for her students future too for the opportunities that both Britons and foreigners will likely miss out on when unfettered mobility between Britain and Europe can no longer be taken for granted They were just getting excited about doing their masters and Ph Ds in other countries And then Brexit happened and they just got trampled she said Scientists and researchers argue that being part of the EU has given British science a huge boost because it allows Britain to recruit the best talent across Europe and take part in important research collaborations and student exchanges without being constrained by national boundaries The bloc s freedom of movement means its million people can live and work visa free in any member state No one knows yet what form Britain s exit from the EU commonly known as Brexit is going to take but immigration was a key issue for Leave voters Many believe some limit should be put on the number of EU citizens moving to Britain Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed to reassert control over British borders She has offered no firm guarantees for the rights of Europeans already living in Britain an uncertainty that weighs heavily over the Europeans who make up percent of the academic workforce in British universities Many universities say the rhetoric over immigration control is also jeopardizing recruitment of researchers and students from further afield Scientists for EU an advocacy group says it has received over letters from researchers describing how Brexit has already impacted their life and work Some are losing doctoral students who pulled out of studentships and job offers Academics are putting plans to relocate to Britain on hold One said their employer a London university immediately imposed a temporary hiring freeze citing uncertainties about student recruitment and research income Adam Durrant a British entrepreneur who founded an aerospace startup supplying climate data to airlines and aircraft manufacturers says he s now considering moving some of his business to a EU country outside of Britain Part of the reason he says is that Brexit will likely make hiring the right people much harder than before In the future it probably means that people would be less interested to come to the U K to work said Durrant There s a huge question mark over my company and my own personal future I will certainly retain a U K presence but my company s focus of gravity may shift elsewhere Scientists say some U K based researchers are already being excluded from joint bids for EU funding to minimize the risks for their colleagues Paul Crowther head of physics and astronomy at the University of Sheffield said a researcher from his department was dropped from an EU grant proposal as a precaution following the Brexit referendum The vote put the U K based researchers in a very awkward position and their participation in EU funded programs could compromise the project he was told The erosion of U K involvement in EU networks has already begun with both the U K and EU science worse off Crowther said Apart from a loss of grant money Brexit will likely cause British scientists and research centers to miss out on shared databases and infrastructure Large scale efforts like studies of rare genetic diseases the building of large facilities are areas that multinational collaborations do much better said Venki Ramakrishnan a Nobel Prize winning biologist and president of Britain s prestigious Royal Society The EU is an important source of research funding for Britain which lags behind many developed countries in state investment in science In Britain s government spent under percent of its GDP on research below the European average and half that of South Korea May s government is clearly aware of the jitters She has promised to increase annual investment in research by billion pounds billion by in hopes her country can remain a world leader in science and innovation Durrant is doubtful that s enough to make a big difference Two billion a year spread across everything isn t going to go very far he said Similar anxieties are being felt at the undergraduate level The European students studying at British universities now pay the same fees as locals and have access to the same government loans Officials have promised this will not change for those applying next year but no one knows what will happen after that Fewer European students appeared to be applying for some of Britain s most competitive university courses including medicine and places at Oxford and Cambridge In September the admission service UCAS reported a percent drop in EU applications for British undergraduate courses starting in Some argue that Britain could become like Switzerland an associate EU state that is opting out of free movement of people while still taking part in limited European science projects It s not all doom and gloom but it will be harder Ramakrishnan said We could make a go of it outside the EU But for that to happen we have to attract talent

President elect Donald Trump is even sworn in But the urgent efforts to make good on a Republican campaign promise six years in the making obscure major GOP divisions over what exactly to replace Obamacare with and how to go about it and how long a transition period to allow before the law s insurance would go away Hard liners are pushing to move as fast as possible bolstered by a GOP base eager to see lawmakers follow through on years of promises But key congressional leaders are keenly concerned about potentially throwing millions off their insurance plans and repeating what they have long decried as Democratic missteps eight years ago sparking a fierce political backlash by moving too far too fast While Trump could sign legislation gutting the Affordable Care Act before the spring bloom a full replacement could take months if not years I d like to do it tomorrow but reality is another matter sometimes said Sen Orrin G Hatch R Utah chairman of the Senate Finance Committee that will help lead the repeal and replace efforts We have to live with the real world And the real world right now is that the Democrats won t help with anything S Donald Trump has campaigned to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act otherwise known as Obamacare once he gets into office Now that he s won the presidency with a majority Republican House and Senate that feat might not prove to be too easy Wonkblog s Max Ehrenfreund explains Daron Taylor The Washington Post Hatch and other high ranking Republican senators are pushing for an extended transition period that could keep large portions of Obamacare in effect until or beyond allowing time to carefully craft a replacement and push the final debate past the midterm elections Many of them like Sen Susan Collins R Maine have been chastened by conversations with insurers and state regulators who are warning of chaos in the market for individual insurance if Congress moves rashly I don t want to leave the people in Maine who are buying insurance on the exchange uninsured because all of a sudden two thirds of them who have subsidies have lost that subsidy Collins said But those Republicans are clashing with GOP colleagues many of them sent to Congress in the midterm anti Obama waves of and who see little reason to dawdle The history of this place is the longer it takes the more exponentially the probability grows that it ll never get done said Rep Mark Meadows R N C elected recently as the new chairman of the hard right House Freedom Caucus Republicans have been saying they have a replacement plan for over two years so why do we need three years Part of the problem is that Republicans have never been able to agree on a replacement plan despite railing against Obamacare for nearly eight years now Their foot dragging is a function of internal divisions and the political peril of floating a detailed alternative that would be closely evaluated for costs and benefits Trump has also been vague promising a terrific replacement that will provide great health care at a fraction of the cost The current battle centers on when exactly to schedule Obamacare s sunset But other fights loom over what precisely a replacement plan should look like whether Obamacare s Medicaid expansion will continue whether lawmakers should also now tackle the future of Medicare and how Congress should assist insurers during the transition Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor on Jan Jonathan Ernst Reuters The battle lines however are familiar with establishment Republicans on one side and conservative insurgents mainly in the House on the other Those dynamics pushed GOP leaders into increasingly dramatic confrontations with President Obama and last year helped force House Speaker John A Boehner R Ohio to retire Come Jan Obama will no longer serve as a foil for Republicans and while Senate Democrats could block parts of a health care overhaul the real fight will occur inside the GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky has announced plans to put an Obamacare repeal on the Senate floor come Jan But that will only set the stage for a future repeal bill that will have to tackle major decisions such as a sunset date and interim measures to stabilize insurance markets So far Trump and key GOP leaders on Capitol Hill have shied away from taking firm positions on repeal and replace but they have done little to tamp down the expectations of conservatives expecting a swift and wholesale substitute We re going to repeal Obamacare lock stock and barrel Vice President elect Mike Pence told donors to the conservative Heritage Foundation recently The number one priority of this administration is to keep that promise to the American people Hard liners on Capitol Hill see Pence and Rep Tom Price R Ga Trump s pick for health and human services secretary as allies in their push for quick and decisive action Pence called on Congress to pass a repeal bill with all deliberate speed but pledged only to then set into motion a process to replace it House Speaker Paul D Ryan R Wis said Thursday that Republicans would move as well and as fast as we can but make sure that the transition does not pull the rug out from under people Transition spokesman Sean Spicer said Friday that Obamacare replacement strategy has been part of discussions Trump and Pence are having with top congressional leaders and that the talks are ongoing The idea is to really figure out the sequencing on both the repeal and the replace he said Conservative activists who pushed a take no prisoners approach toward the Obama administration say their patience is limited When Republicans have the House the Senate and the White House you don t wait said Adam Brandon president and chief executive of FreedomWorks a conservative advocacy group I m a Cleveland Indians fan I only get a shot at a World Series every couple decades When you have a shot to do it you do it That s it Democrats and many health care experts are warning that a swift repeal could lead insurers to stop selling policies to individuals on federally mandated exchanges More than million Americans are covered under those policies Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell briefed Senate Democrats on Thursday on the expected unraveling of Obamacare s insurance exchanges according to people familiar with her remarks inside the closed door meeting Delayed replacement is a situation where it is basically repeal and chaos in terms of what will ensue because of the uncertainty that will get presented to insurers providers consumers and states Burwell told reporters after the meeting Republicans want to end Obamacare s system of penalties and subsidies But many including Trump want to continue to ban insurers from denying coverage or sharply increasing rates for the sick Experts warn that repeal and delay under those conditions would prompt insurers to flee the individual market Linda J Blumberg a senior fellow at the Urban Institute said insurers could face as much as billion in losses if healthy individuals leave the market once the subsidies and penalties are eliminated That billion is the tip of the iceberg Blumberg said With all of these changes and the uncertainty it is hard to predict how bad the risk is going to get Keeping insurers in the market during the transition could require Congress to step in with bailout payments something that would be deeply unpopular among conservative lawmakers The insurance industry should understand that there s a new sheriff in town said Rep Ken Buck R Colo a Freedom Caucus member They signed up for Obamacare and if they want to make a profit they re going to have to figure out how to make a profit in a free market insurance industry The strategy of repealing Obamacare without first replacing it reflects not only the wishes of the GOP base but also Senate arithmetic There will be a slim to Republican majority come January and while Republicans can gut Obamacare with a simple majority using arcane budget rules passing a complete replacement will require votes Only by dismantling Obamacare first Republicans say will they have a chance to persuade enough Democrats to support a replacement plan and Democrats have already signaled that they will not do so We all know we have to repeal it to get them to even settle down and work with us at all Hatch said Incoming Senate Democratic leader Charles E Schumer D N Y however has rejected that strategy We re not going to do a replacement If they repeal without a replacement they will own it he told The Washington Post recently But the Republican base prodded by conservative media outlets and well organized activist groups has been loath to accept Democratic obstruction as an excuse for inaction One prominent activist Jenny Beth Martin co founder of the Tea Party Patriots suggested that Trump could goose the repeal and replace efforts by reversing an administrative ruling that gave financial assistance to congressional members and staff who were forced onto the Obamacare exchanges under a compromise included in the original law I don t think anyone thinks that you re going to flip a switch but the replacement for it needs to happen quickly she said We want it done as quickly as it possibly can be done Brandon was even blunter This is going to be a hard thing for Republicans but tough cookies he said They re going to have to push this through using parliamentary maneuvers and guess what It s hard The political risk in doing nothing is why you got Donald Trump in the first place he added The old excuses of having divided government they re gone A few strident Obamacare critics are urging activists to soften a bit They have to look at the complexity of the problem here and hopefully they ll recognize that it s not quite so simple said Sen Ron Johnson R Wis

highly critical of Donald Trump s comments about Russia Michael Reynolds EPA But McCain and Graham who frequently criticized Trump before and after his election have often bucked Republican leaders and their embrace of a wide ranging Russia probe does not necessarily signal support from other Republicans including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky Sen Susan Collins Maine one of the more moderate Republicans in the upper chamber suggested a bipartisan investigation may be useful toward achieving an objective accounting of any alleged meddling by foreign adversaries The purpose of any investigation whether by the Obama administration or Congress is not to question or relitigate the results of any past or present Presidential election she said in a statement Instead any review must focus on the long overdue task of improving the defenses of the United States against cyber attacks including those that might seek to affect or influence political campaign Another GOP senator Sen James Lankford Okla who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee agreed with McCain and Graham s decision to support a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber intrusion by Russia in the U S

panel will continue to conduct vigorous oversight of all intelligence matters But he made no specific mention of Russia unlike Sen Ron Johnson R Wis said cyber threats by America s rivals including Russia pose serious challenges that should not be politicized or viewed through a partisan lens Johnson said as chairman Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations panel he would continue to hold hearings based on fact not innuendo for the sole purpose of informing effective policy and appropriate countermeasures Republicans may be loath to join calls for such a wide ranging investigation into Russia s election related activities given that Trump has dismissed the CIA claims as ridiculous They may worry about picking an obvious fight

ties to Putin Republicans in a to Senate have only the slimmest of margins to get him confirmed should Democrats decide to uniformly oppose the nomination Only three Republicans would need to side

	{ "text": "Two years ago Jonathan Clark was sending his four school age kids to four different schools in Detroit We were driving miles a week just to and from school he said His three oldest all girls ages to were enrolled at charters privately run schools funded by the government that promise better educational outcomes Clark was able to send his kids to schools all over the city because of school choice the policy that allows kids to get educated outside their home district But Clark said the conditions at these charter schools were no different from what s typical of a public school in Detroit a lack of resources needed to educate students high teacher turnover and low test scores These are all things they give bad marks to DPS Detroit public schools on he said but charters are doing the same Analysis Trump s cabinet looks increasingly conventional but far from moderate Donald Trump s personnel picks have stayed within the Republican mainstream few are Trump cronies and some were even opponents of the president elect Read more That s why Clark is alarmed by Donald Trump s nomination of Betsy DeVos to lead the US Department of Education DeVos a billionaire and conservative activist from the state has been one of the strongest defenders in Michigan of expanding charter schools and choice DeVos and her husband Dick have long been a force in education policy efforts in Michigan as well as other sensitive political issues such as the Michigan legislature s decision to pass right to work legislation The DeVoses have contributed at least m to state lawmakers and Michigan s GOP party including support for a failed m effort to pass a pro school voucher voter referendum in Public education advocates who oppose DeVos s nomination point to Michigan s education record particularly in Detroit where nearly half of students attend charters Since a quarter century ago charter advocates have pursued an agenda that has included a lift on the cap for how many can open in the state as well as an expansion of school choice Along the way the state s academic performance has dropped and Detroit has probably felt the biggest impact Though charter advocates point to studies that suggest student gains have been made at charters the city s disconnected array of schools has developed into a frenetic status quo Just this year the district has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy prompting teachers facing potential payless work days to stage mass protests and a federal lawsuit is now attempting to assert a constitutional right to literacy an argument couched in the dismal performance scores of Detroit students What s more the state s policies and regulation of charters has been so lax critics routinely refer to the city s educational landscape as the wild west Indeed a federal audit this year noted Michigan s charter school law does not include provisions for regulating conflict of interest issues The state also allows for profit charters to be established a practice prohibited elsewhere Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster New Jersey Facebook Twitter Pinterest Trump stands with Betsy DeVos after their meeting at the main clubhouse at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster New Jersey Photograph Mike Segar Reuters Since Detroit s population has dropped nearly while its school district s attendance has plummeted nearly a signal of the proliferation of charters and use of choice in the city The situation in Michigan is such that even charter advocates criticize the state s approach and DeVos s devotion to maintaining it It doesn t matter that charter schools aren t giving any of the things they promised years ago said Stephen Henderson a Detroit native and editorial page editor of the Detroit Free Press who along with his two children attended charters She and her family funds any effort to block any changes or accountability or standards that would perhaps produce better results for us But the pick underscored the polarizing views of DeVos In her home state Michigan s governor and attorney general echoed Trump s remarks about her qualifications Dan Quisenberry president of the Michigan Association of Public School Academies downplayed criticisms of her background saying her business experience and previous role as the Michigan GOP chairwoman showed she could lead a large organization and handle political issues Betsy is a person who will put kids before adults he said She s going to put students and parents ahead of politics Michigan indeed has some high performing charter schools including in Detroit Many supporters point to a Stanford study that found charter students in the state learned at a faster rate than those in public schools with two months of gains or three months in Detroit Still the study found that slightly more than half of Detroit charter schools failed to perform significantly better in math and reading than counterparts some even worse This summer charter school advocates including DeVos s group the Great Lakes Education Project agreed to some additional accountability measures as part of a m investment to overhaul the governance of Detroit public schools Schools must now be assessed regularly and new schools accredited But a provision to create a commission overseeing Detroit schools was stripped from the legislation after intense lobbying by charter advocates and DeVos What they feared was the accountability Henderson said DeVos whose father in law founded Amway a marketing company that previously settled tax fraud accusations for m has long leveraged her wealth to target Republicans who have not boosted her education agenda After the commission was derailed DeVos donated m to state Republican lawmakers over a two month period Henderson said GOP lawmakers had told him that in the runup to the decision to axe the Detroit commission DeVos explicitly stated that she wouldn t donate to their campaign efforts if they didn t flip their votes on the issue Trump s transition team declined to make DeVos available for an interview and did not provide comment for this story Quisenberry said critics namely teachers unions who point to DeVos political influence usually are involved very much in the same influence on the other side What the Detroit commission was about was whose political influence was going to win out he said The teachers union was very involved Clark believes the commission would have addressed the distribution and quality of of schools in the city in his neighborhood there is just one operational school for kids If schools in our neighborhood were open and up to standards and producing a quality educational experience then we wouldn t have had to go to four different schools all over the city Clark said Clark now sends his three older kids to private school But he knows that is off the table for many other parents in the city where of

	{ "text": "If Rex Tillerson is nominated as the next secretary of state it would confirm Vladimir Putin as one of the strategic victors of the US presidential election Barack Obama has ordered an inquiry into covert Russian intervention in the campaign which the CIA says was designed to secure a victory for Donald Trump But whether or not Russian intervention made a significant difference to the outcome a Tillerson appointment would represent a significant gain for Moscow While the other leading candidates for the job hold largely traditional and adversarial views on Russia the outgoing chief executive of Exxon Mobil has a history of close business ties to Putin who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in The Wall Street Journal reported Friends and associates said few US citizens are closer to Mr Putin than Mr Tillerson The year old Texas oilman spent much of his career working on Russian deals including a agreement giving Exxon Mobil access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state owned Russian oil company OAO Rosneft the opportunity to invest in Exxon Mobil s operations overseas Tillerson is also friends with the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin a former interpreter who worked as chief of staff for Putin when he was deputy mayor in St Petersburg in the mid s Sechin sometimes described as the second most powerful man in Russia is now under US sanctions He has said that one of his ambitions is to ride the roads in the United States on motorcycles with Tillerson The Exxon Rosneft agreement was frozen when sanctions were imposed on Russia in following the annexation of Crimea and covert military intervention in eastern Ukraine Exxon Mobil estimated the sanctions cost it bn and Tillerson has argued strenuously for the measures to be lifted Trump s choice suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it Thomas Wright Brookings Institution We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions he said at a shareholders meeting In June two years after sanctions were imposed and in an apparent show of support for Sechin Tillerson reportedly turned up at a St Petersburg economic summit If the sanctions were lifted the Arctic project would probably go ahead and Tillerson s retirement fund of Exxon Mobil stock would increase in value He would most likely have to divest himself of stock by the time he entered the office on the seventh floor of the state department It might be harder to divorce his judgments entirely from the oil company where he spent his career Trump s choice of Rex Tillerson suggests he wants to make good on his promise to cut deals with Russia instead of containing it said Thomas Wright who has written extensively on Trump s foreign policy at the Brookings Institution Tillerson has a relationship with Putin and he opposed the sanctions imposed on Russia after the annexation of Crimea This will alarm those worried about Russian intentions in Europe Praising Tillerson in an interview with Fox News Sunday Trump said To me a great advantage is that he knows many of the players in the world and he knows them well Lest there be any doubt about which players the president elect had in mind Trump added He does massive deals in Russia not for himself but for the company A culture of intimidation Stacks and burn off from the Exxon Mobil refinery at dusk in St Bernard Parish Louisiana Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stacks and burn off from the Exxon Mobil refinery at dusk in St Bernard Parish Louisiana Photograph Gerald Herbert AP In a very real sense Tillerson has been a head of a state within a state Exxon Mobil is bigger economically than many countries It has its own foreign policy and its own contracted security forces As a state it has much in common with the one run by Putin and Sechin Reporting on Exxon was not only harder than reporting on the Bin Ladens it was harder than reporting on the CIA by an order of magnitude said Steve Coll who wrote about the company in a book Private Empire They have a culture of intimidation that they bring to bear in their external relations and it is plenty understood inside the corporation too They make people nervous they make people afraid Coll now a journalism professor at Columbia University told Texas Monthly Running the state department would not be like running Exxon Mobil however For a start Tillerson would have to audition in front of a sceptical Senate On Saturday leading Democrats were painting him as a Moscow stooge The New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said on Twitter Rex Tillerson as secretary of state would guarantee Russia has a willing accomplice in the president s cabinet With a slim majority it would only take three Republican senators in revolt to cast Tillerson s job in doubt He would face aggressive questioning from Republican foreign policy hawks led by John McCain I have obviously concerns about his relationship with Vladimir Putin who is a thug and a murderer but obviously we will have hearings on that issue and other issues concerning him will be examined and then it s the time to make up your mind on whether to vote yes or no the Arizona senator told CNN on Saturday A US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values would be a disaster for Russia Andrei Kozyrev former Russian foreign minister McCain s former chief of staff Mark Salter was far more blunt on Twitter Tillerson would sell out Nato for Sakhalin oil and his pal Vlad he wrote Should be a rough confirmation hearing and a no vote on the Senate floor Even if Tillerson were to be confirmed he would not take over the state department with a free hand to rewrite policy He would face a striking culture clash with the institution the bastion of foreign policy orthodoxy which would have an ally in the secretary of defence nominee retired general James Mattis who is likely to oppose any erosion of Nato solidarity in the face of Moscow s assertiveness in Europe Nevertheless Dmitri Trenin director of the Carnegie Endowment Moscow Center argued Tillerson as secretary of state would signify the greatest discontinuity in US foreign policy since the end of the cold war Not just in US Russian relations a Trump Tillerson foreign policy would be squarely focused on US national interests rather than on its global pretensions or any ideology Trenin added It would be hard nosed and no nonsense not averse to the use of force but in response to a real rather than imaginary threat In one word realist That is a change that would be undoubtedly be welcomed by Putin whose vision of foreign policy centres on spheres of interest controlled by global powers run by strongmen like himself Andrei Kozyrev a former Russian foreign minister argued that the Kremlin should be careful what it wishes for The paradoxical situation now is that Russia is hoping for a US foreign policy based on realpolitik rather than on values but that would be a disaster for Russia said Kozyrev who is now at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington Why Because the only interest America has in ending the conflicts in eastern Ukraine or in Syria is actually in American values that America should be concerned and do everything to alleviate the humanitarian situation and they should help nations to find their path to democracy The realpolitik situation is that Russia is stuck in both military conflicts If you look at this with a cold eye you say Let them go on and let them enjoy the disaster they have in eastern Ukraine Kozyrev said Look at Syria By realpolitik the Americans would rather sit and wait while

intervened in the election to ensure Trump s victory Fears of retaliation rose within US intelligence agencies over a tense weekend that saw Trump publicly dismiss not only the assessment but the basic competence of the intelligence apparatus When the president elect s transition team is attempting to discredit the entire intelligence community IC it has never been more important for the IC and Congress to guard against possible political pressure or retaliation against intelligence analysts Ron Wyden an Oregon Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee told the Guardian Like his Democratic colleagues on the panel Wyden is pressing Barack Obama for additional public disclosures revealing Russian electoral interference Such pressure has placed the CIA and other intelligence agencies between the incoming president to whom they will soon answer and a chorus of legislators mostly but not exclusively Democrats who consider the Russia hack a national emergency It is not possible to gauge precisely how deep fears of retaliation run within the intelligence world Two currently serving intelligence officers told the Guardian this weekend they had not heard their colleagues express such concerns One noted that civil service laws prevented Trump from launching a purge but also called attention to a report that Trump is combing through the energy department bureaucracy to identify people who have attended climate change policy conferences Former intelligence officers told the Guardian they considered retaliation by Trump to be all but a certainty after he is sworn into office next month Trump still has several appointments to make at the highest levels of the intelligence apparatus picks which are likely to be bellwethers for the new president s attitudes toward the agencies There is not just smoke here There is a alarm fire the sirens are wailing the Russians provided the lighter fluid Glenn Carle former CIA officer There is not just smoke here There is a blazing alarm fire the sirens are wailing the Russians provided the lighter fluid and Trump is standing half burnt and holding a match said Glenn Carle a retired CIA officer and interrogator The facts hurt Trump won t like the truth and he will without question seek to destroy those individuals or organizations that say or do anything that he thinks harm his precious grandiosity After congressional Democrats called for additional briefings and public disclosures about an intelligence consensus that Russia made a deliberate decision to intervene in the election Barack Obama ordered a new review of the evidence On Friday the Washington Post reported that intelligence sources believe the Russians decided to penetrate the Democratic National Committee s digital networks with the goal of aiding Trump not merely to spread uncertainty about the outcome of the election In response Trump attacked the credibility of the intelligence agencies on which he will rely for early warning of security emergencies and geopolitical developments His transition team said in a statement These are the same people who said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction Adam Schiff the leading Democrat on the House intelligence committee said Trump cannot abide the idea that Russian hacking helped his campaign and was lashing out in a manner that undermined confidence in his handling of intelligence If Trump is willing to disregard sound intelligence now and demean the hard working and patriotic Americans who produced it I fear what he will do as president when confronted with unpleasant truths Schiff said Will he accept the best insights of our agencies or punish them for daring to contradict his assumptions Trump s clash with the CIA comes at a moment of acute turmoil within intelligence circles Obama officials jeopardized the tenure of National Security Agency chief Mike Rogers in a seemingly thwarted bureaucratic reorganization of the US surveillance and cybersecurity apparatus Congressional sources have told the Guardian they expect to hold a public hearing on the issue in January Should Trump go through with the reshuffle it will leave him appointing an NSA director as well as a director of national intelligence after James Clapper announced his resignation last month Trump has also been noncommittal about retaining the FBI director James Comey whose bureau houses significant sympathy for Trump Congressional Republicans are in an uncomfortable position between a president of their own party and Russia a traditional adversary Devin Nunes a California Republican who chairs the House intelligence committee said on Saturday Russian electoral hacking was no surprise He also blamed Obama for coming late to the threat out of delusions of resetting relations with Russia a policy that Trump is also pursuing On Sunday anti Trump GOP hawks Lindsey Graham and John McCain offered a different path joining with leading Democratic senators Chuck Schumer and Jack Reed to plead for a bipartisan inquiry into the alleged Russian hacking which they said endangered the country We have an obligation to inform the public about recent cyberattacks that have cut to the heart of our free society the senators said in a joint statement Democrats and Republicans must work together and across the jurisdictional lines of the Congress to examine these recent incidents thoroughly and devise comprehensive solutions to deter and defend against further cyberattacks Trump reports that Russia influenced US election are ridiculous Also on Sunday Elijah Cummings the Maryland Democrat on the investigations heavy House oversight committee pressured the Republican committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and speaker of the house Paul Ryan to join us now in our effort to launch a robust and truly bipartisan investigation of Russian interference in our election that puts our nation s interests over the interests of any political party FBI covered up Russian influence on Trump s election win Harry Reid claims Read more Carle the retired CIA officer said Trump s temperament had played into Russia s hands and put the president elect on a collision course with the CIA He said Look in my professional assessment as an intelligence officer Trump has a reflexive defensive monumentally narcissistic personality for whom the facts and national interest are irrelevant and the only thing that counts is whatever gives personal advantage and directs attention to himself He is about the juiciest intelligence target an intelligence office could imagine He groans with vulnerabilities He will only work with individuals or entities that agree with him and build him up and he is a shockingly easy intelligence target to manipulate Were Trump an intelligence officer himself Carle said he would be removed and possibly charged with having accepted the clandestine support of a hostile power to the harm of the United

political mainstream Even if they don t have the votes to shoot down any nominees Democratic senators will grill them in committee hearings They can slow the confirmation process with procedural moves

picks will face such aggressive scrutiny which Democrats insist is not merely reflexive partisan opposition Retired Gen James Mattis is expected to sail through his confirmation to be defense secretary even though his recent tenure in the active duty military means he ll need a special waiver that requires votes in the Senate But some of Trump s picks Democrats say represent existential threats to the basic mission of the departments they ve been tapped to lead and so the nominees have no business in those jobs There s Trump s reported pick for secretary of state Rex Tillerson chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil who has warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin There s Trump s pick to head the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt who has made a name for himself by suing the agency There s Andy Puzder Trump s choice for the Labor Department a fast food executive who wants to replace workers with robots There s Betsy DeVos a school choice advocate seen as hostile to public education whom Trump wants to put in charge of the Education Department And there s attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions an anti immigration hard liner whom the Senate once rejected for a federal judgeship over past racially insensitive comments Democratic congressional aides and outside groups will spend the coming weeks poring over the financial statements personal histories and public utterances of Trump s most polarizing Cabinet selections hoping to find information that could turn them into the next Tom Daschle or Zoe Baird Barack Obama and Bill Clinton Cabinet nominees who were forced to withdraw after damaging issues came to light during the confirmation process And Democrats have reason to believe Trump s nominees provide an especially rich vein for digging because according to reports few have been subjected to a traditionally thorough vetting process by his transition team Many are wealthy business executives with sprawling financial entanglements and no political experience or the scrutiny that comes with it What s unusual about Trump s Cabinet picks is that so few of them come from politics which means that they re going to have a harder time than usual going through the traditional vet and public evaluation said Simon Rosenberg president of the Democratic think tank NDN Some of them are going to crash Some of them aren t going to make it because of things that are going to come up in their background Democrats will have to pick their battles and priorities will likely be decided based not only by how threatening they find Trump s nominees but how vulnerable the nominees are after some digging Related Donald Trump Builds Cabinet with Old Friends and Some Rivals Much of it depends on what s uncovered in the vetting process said Jim Manley a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada As Senator Daschle found out one little thing can trip you up Daschle was nominated to head the Department of Health and Human Services in but removed his name after controversy over his taxes emerged Old domestic abuse allegations related to a messy divorce have already surfaced with Puzder But complicated financial issues are more likely to trip up Trump s nominees than personal indiscretions especially given the number of super wealthy candidates Trump has chosen The Senate Finance Committee has developed a reputation as somewhat of a killing field for nominees in recent years Manley said They ve developed the experience to really pick apart the financials And Trump s team may be flying blind to some extent His transition team has reportedly forgone the rigorous vetting process traditionally performed on potential nominees before they are announced publicly leaving his picks potentially vulnerable to surprises Selecting Rep Mike Pompeo R kansas as CIA director was pretty simple said Rep Devin Nunes R California who is working on Trump s transition team They asked me who would be the person for the agency and I said without a doubt that Pompeo would be a great pick Nunes told Politico Dan Kanninen a former Obama White House official who helped choose candidates for jobs in the Environmental Protection Agency said it takes weeks or months for even the best transition teams to properly vet candidates With Trump none of that as far as we can tell happened before the election And now if it is happening at all it s happening in a matter of days based on the gut on the president elect he said It would not surprise me at all given how little we know and frankly how little the Trump team knows if something came up with of a magnitude that might kill some of their nominations Even under the best of circumstances things get missed Clinton rescinded Baird s nomination to be

ago facing Republican obstruction Senate Democrats decided to kill the filibuster for executive branch appointments which means they now cannot force Republicans to find the votes needed to break a filibuster Republicans need only votes in the Senate to confirm Trump s Cabinet picks Democrats would need three Republicans to join them to shoot down any of Trump s nominees and so far none have expressed interest in taking up the cause Some Democrats unsurprisingly are having buyer s remorse about the filibuster change including Reid s successor as Democratic Leader Sen Chuck Schumer of New York I wanted for Supreme Court and Cabinet but I didn t prevail Schumer told The Washington Post Still he vowed opposition to some nominees however possible If it s somebody who is out of the mainstream Schumer said we ll fight tooth and nail and use every tool we have The Senate has traditionally deferred to new presidents wishes in filling out their Cabinets approving many nominees without bothering to even take formal votes Recent incoming presidents have had to withdraw only one or two Cabinet picks if any at all and the Senate has voted to outright reject just three nominees

	{ "text": "WASHINGTON The FBI warrant that shook Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in its final two weeks has been unsealed and the lawyer who requested it says it offers nothing at all to merit the agency s actions leading up to the Nov election The warrant was released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Los Angeles lawyer Randy Schoenberg who wants to determine what probable cause the agency provided to suspect material on disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner s computer might be incriminating to Clinton Weiner is the estranged husband of Clinton s top aide Huma Abedin Under the Fourth Amendment search and seizure can only be granted when proof of probable cause of criminal findings has been documented The letter confirms news reports in late October that the FBI had detected non content header information suggesting correspondence with accounts involved in its already completed investigation of Clinton s private email server The FBI request concludes there is probable cause to believe that the laptop contained evidence contraband fruits and or items illegally possessed without providing specifics I see nothing at all in the search warrant application that would give rise to probable cause nothing that would make anyone suspect that there was anything on the laptop beyond what the FBI had already searched and determined not to be evidence of a crime nothing to suggest that there would be anything other than routine correspondence between Clinton and Abedin Schoenberg said in an email to USA TODAY It remains unknown why they thought they might find evidence of a crime why they felt it necessary to inform Congress and why they even sought this search warrant he said I am appalled The FBI s Manhattan office did not immediately return a call seeking comment Clinton campaign officials echoed Schoenberg s complaints Tuesday Campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said on Twitter that the unsealed filings regarding Huma s emails reveals Comey s intrusion on the election was as utterly unjustified as we suspected at time Read more New emails under review in Clinton case emerged from Weiner probe FBI declares it is finally done investigating Hillary Clinton s email The FBI concluded in July that there was no clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws and that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case Then two weeks before the election Comey sent a three paragraph letter to Congress that said in the course of an unrelated investigation investigators found emails that appear to be pertinent to Clinton s private email server Comey also wrote that he could not assess whether the material was significant The letter was so vague that Clinton s opponents seized on it to shift the narrative from a damaging drumbeat of news stories about Donald Trump including his past treatment of women Trump called it bigger than Watergate and predicted that the FBI would right

client never saw and hadn t or even been alerted to preventing them from responding publicly in the final days of the campaign Two days before the election Comey confirmed there was no new information At the same time Comey was in possession of evidence showing Russia was hacking into the Democratic Party apparatus and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid D Nev accused him of holding back explosive information about Russian interference The retiring senator said Comey may have violated the Hatch Act which prohibits activity directed towards the success or failure of a candidate On Monday former

impact on the race and that she would almost certainly be president elect if the election had been held the day before the letter He cited late deciding voters breaking strongly against her enough to cost her Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania Schoenberg said more information needs to be made public before the matter is put to rest The FBI agent s name has not been disclosed but I think that it may be appropriate to find out his her name and determine what the motivations were since it must have been obvious to the FBI that there was no real probable cause to believe they would find evidence

	{ "text": "WASHINGTON President elect Donald Trump campaigned on a vow to repeal what he claims are job killing federal regulations including rules limiting power plant emissions protecting rivers and streams and preventing banks from reckless lending Easier said than done The same deliberate process used to enact the Clean Power Plant rule the waters of the U S Clean Water Rule or regulations under the Dodd Frank law designed to clamp down on Wall Street usually requires the same long slog to undo them making quick repeal unattainable In general rule changes originate from the agencies who must offer a legal scientific or other legitimate reason in defense of the proposed change and solicit public comments first before a new rule or its repeal can take effect In most cases the final rule may not become effective until at least days after its publication in the Federal Register The process is laborious but that shouldn t stop every agency head from setting it in motion Andy Koenig vice president of policy at the Koch affiliated Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce wrote in a recent column on the group s website The very fact that it is so time consuming makes it essential for agencies to start the process immediately Republicans seek quick repeal of latest Obama administration regulations Small businesses can expect policy changes under Trump But a Republican president and a compliant Congress controlled by Republicans can still do quite a bit in short order to block a host of proposed regulations or reverse rules that were recently implemented Overall critics say regulations pose a trillion drag on to the U S economy every year according to some estimates though agencies also design rules to maximize economic benefits Stakeholders have been weighing in about the rules they d like to see tossed Among them is the House Freedom Caucus the hard right faction of House lawmakers who have clashed with congressional leaders in recent years The group Wednesday asked the incoming Trump administration to jettison rules its members view as burdensome costly or unworkable including ones setting nutrition standards for school lunches requiring certain animal and plant inspections and development of alternative fuels Despite some steep hurdles here s what Trump and Congress can do Incoming presidents can prevent regulations that have yet to be finalized from ever taking effect It s standard practice for a new administration to freeze any regulations that are in the pipeline until the incoming regime can review them said Jerry Ellig senior research fellow at George Mason University s Mercatus Center President Obama did just than when he came into office in as did his predecessors If it s something that the current administration has finished and sent to the Federal Register but it isn t published before Inauguration Day then it s easy for a new administration to pull those rules back he said Many could still go forward after the review is complete and the Trump administration supports them Congress also has a limited window where it can undo rules with a simple majority vote that cannot be filibustered Such resolutions of disapproval must be passed and signed within legislative days from their publication in the federal register and their insertion into the Congressional Record Under the Congressional Review Act agencies must report on their rulemaking activities to Congress and provide lawmakers a legislative roadmap to overturn those rules if they oppose them according to the Congressional Research Service The Mercatus Center lists Obama administration rules adopted since June that could be subject to the review act They include rules on implementing school wellness policies regulating municipal solid waste landfills and food labeling guidelines But the incoming Congress will have to be picky because the law requires that rule reversals can only be done one at a time With all the other priorities facing them such as working on a budget and considering Trump s nominees there s may not be much floor time for wholesale regulatory rollback Ellig said That hurdle helps explain why the Congressional Review Act has been used only once since it became law years ago In Congress and the George W Bush administration overturned a Clinton administration rule setting an ergonomics standard for the workplace Agencies can decide not to enforce certain regulations because they re focused on other priorities Or the Trump administration could choose to stop defending rules if they are the subject of a court challenge That passive approach is a pretty easy way to undermine laws that are already around and public protections that already exist said Lisa Gilbert director of Public Citizen s Congress Watch a government watchdog group Deciding not to defend the regulation in court wouldn t guarantee the rule s demise Affected third parties would likely still be arguing for its enforcement and judges could still rule on the legality of the provision But it could leave open questions that we would obviously rather have answered about our regulatory state Gilbert said Lawmakers could pass a law undoing the rule The cleanest and in many ways steepest path to eliminating a rule is to have Congress approve legislation doing just that That s what it will probably take to gut some of the Obama administration s most high profile regulations such as ones associated with clean water clean power overtime protections the Affordable Care Act and Wall Street reform Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally in Grand Rapids Mich on Nov Photo Paul Sancya AP Within that category there are several approaches using spending bills to insert language known as riders preventing an agency from allocating funds to enforce a regulation using a process known as reconciliation to fast track bills to undo rules and passing bills through the regular legislative process That last option is least desirable for regulatory reformers because it could take years and it gives Democrats the chance to stop a rule rollback through filibuster None of this includes the executive orders that President Trump could undo with a stroke of his pen namely President Obama s deportation protections for millions of undocumented immigrants who arrived here as young children Trump has already unveiled his plan to tackle regulation reform Ask all department heads to submit a list of every wasteful and unnecessary regulation which kills jobs and which does not improve public safety and eliminate them Gilbert with Public Citizen said it s hard to predict how many of the Obama era rules will survive Our success in preserving any of them is going to depend on our ability to make it very clear to the American public what it means to take away these things that are so populist so important she said Nobody wants to lose pay raises they ve already achieved or

	{ "text": "WASHINGTON The very first President s Intelligence Checklist the predecessor to what s now known as the President s Daily Briefing was delivered to President John F Kennedy on a June Saturday in Typewritten on eight pages of by inch paper and stamped For the President Only Top Secret it contained two sentence briefs culled from diplomatic military intelligence and press sources six shorter notes and maps of Laos and the Congo Today President Obama receives the document on an iPad The articles are somewhat longer and sometimes have dissenting opinions The maps can be interactive and the briefings can include video The differences aren t just technological After serving presidents and now preparing to brief the th President elect Donald Trump the President s Daily Briefing has had to adjust to the reading habits and decision making styles of each commander in chief And the ways in which it s produced read and discussed provide a rare insight into how presidents approach national security issues It s the only standing meeting he has every day Even if we don t have the meeting he gets the document said Obama s deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes Everyday there s the possibility that he ll see something that will cause him to move the entire U S government in a new direction There s nothing else like that For Obama the PDB process paints a portrait of a methodical president who s often disdainful of raw unfiltered intelligence in favor of more analytical perspective He encourages dissenting opinions He s interested in open source intelligence including press accounts and increasingly social media in addition to old fashioned spycraft and intercepted communications President elect Trump has yet to make a formal mark on intelligence He s still getting a daily intelligence briefing designed for and catered to Obama He s reading it largely as a courtesy by the incumbent president part of a bipartisan tradition dating back to President Harry Truman But Trump has already suggested a different style of receiving intelligence For the first month he received in person intelligence briefings only once a week although his transition team now says it s three times a week But Trump himself has suggested a more ad hoc system of being updated only when major developments warrant I get it when I need it Trump told Fox News Sunday I don t have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years he said I don t need that But I do say If something should change let us know In skipping daily briefings Trump shows ambivalence toward intel agencies Aides Trump gets frequent classified briefings Obama has said much the same about his daily briefing albeit much later in his presidency Over the years you accumulate knowledge Obama said in a YouTube interview earlier this year Now I ve got enough of a baseline of knowledge I ve seen problems come up before I ve seen patterns that have emerged I might not have to go into the briefing book as deeply as I did I m skimming I m looking at are there significant differences The frequency the duration the format the depth the subject matter even the distribution list are all up to the president In a book published earlier this year former CIA officer David Priess argued that the PDB has had to adapt to each president who has receives it and will continue to evolve to meet the president s personality learning style and priorities If a new president comes in and he wants the PDB presented through interpretive dance he or she will get that said Priess author of The President s Book of Secrets The Untold Story of Intelligence Briefings There will be a whole lot of intelligence officers taking dancing lessons The President s Daily Briefing is what its name implies Priess said It is brief Everything is not going to make it in It s daily If it s not breaking or not current it doesn t get in he said But the most important word is president Is this deserving of his attention That s a question that the intelligence community is constantly trying to reassess And the transition period is a critical time for the incoming president to get up to speed on intelligence issues and for the intelligence community to get to know the president elect Current and former national security officials say frequent in person briefings with the president and the president elect are an essential part of making sure the commander in chief is well informed There is a certain amount of trial and error to really settle in to what the new team wants former CIA director Michael Hayden said In his book Playing to the Edge American Intelligence in the Age of Terror he describes what the intelligence community crudely refers to as the aw s moment Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four star general Michael Hayden is a retired Air Force four star general former director of the National Security Agency and former director of the CIA Photo Jasper Colt USA TODAY It s attempt by intelligence officials to challenge the worldview of the president elect s political advisers with a dose of reality Hayden calls it phenomenon of the unpleasant fact That s when the intelligence guys give the president information and analysis that cuts across the policy or politics grain of the administration You re telling them something they don t want to hear and don t want to believe he said And it s important to do that in an in person briefing as opposed to the written product You have to shake the preferred narrative of the policymaker Hayden said And you need the ability to do that face to face and to do it with your tone and your words and your body language to communicate as opposed to just throwing it over the transom When Obama first took office the intelligence community grumbled that Obama or at least his national security staff wanted the reports so brief that they called them PDB haiku Hayden s early briefings of Obama he was replaced three weeks into Obama s presidency were far less tactical than the briefings President George W Bush was receiving But Michael Leiter who directed the National Counterterrorism Center under both Bush and Obama said he saw Obama grow in his use of intelligence from those early months His inclination from the start was less about the tactics and more about the strategy and more about how the U S was perceived in the world and interacted in the world he said But there certainly was an evolution To me that was most crystallized around the time of underwear bomber he said referring to the Christmas Day plot to bring down a Detroit bound airliner That so changed the president s perception of how detail oriented he had to be on these things From then on he said any terrorism threat the president was briefed about also had to include an operational briefing about what was being done to address it Still it s a difficult balancing act for the president and his briefing team Rhodes said the president needs to be disciplined enough not to be distracted by the uncorroborated bits of information or to attribute more credibility to information only because it s classified Sometimes you are so focused on what is secret that you re not looking at what s right in front of your eyes Rhodes said in an interview with USA TODAY before the election It s worrisome to get into raw intelligence he said Because you may have some intercept that you think is great but it could be some official in some country it could be just their view or what they hope happens Or sometimes they know that the National Security Agency is listening and they want us to intercept that raw intelligence That s where the job of ODNI is very hard Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communication Ben Rhodes Photo Mandel Ngan AFP Getty Images ODNI is the Office of the Director of National Intelligence an office created by Congress in in a series of post intelligence reforms While the briefing is assembled by ODNI with input from the entire intelligence community the CIA by virtue of its historic role and experience in analysis still has an outsized role in the process Obama has said he s conscientious about hearing from a broad array of experts I ve learned to be pretty good at listening carefully to people who know a lot more than I do about a topic Obama said in the YouTube interview And taking sure that any dissenting voices are in the same room at the same time But while Obama says he listens to all voices not all of those voices feel that they re being heard A report from the Intelligence Community Inspector General interviewed intelligence analysts across the government and found that broader community participation in the President s Daily Brief PDB remains a challenge Rhodes said the president has increasingly asked for lower level analysts who are experts in a political topic to brief him personally a practice that has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter s presidency Let s get the analysts who are living through these issues every day Rhodes said He likes that so he s tried to do that more The daily book often contains dissenting views which Leiter said were often the most illuminating thing in a PDB article And under Obama non urgent raw intelligence often gets shopped around the intelligence community for corroboration and analysis before making it to the president And highly sensitive information gleaned from top secret sources and methods is balanced with open source intelligence the kind of information that s available to anyone reading a newspaper Rebalancing the PDB Presidents of course also send signals back to the intelligence community about their policy priorities and that gets reflected in their briefings Richard Nixon s had a heavy emphasis on Vietnam and China Ronald Reagan s was almost singularly obsessed with the Soviet Union And for the last two presidents the Middle East has dominated the PDB to the extent that the White House has occasionally had to remind intelligence agencies that Obama wants a wider aperture You could write the PDB every day and never talk about anything except the Middle East and Russia Rhodes said To the point where we ve had to say Hey guys we re rebalancing to the Asia Pacific Make sure that s represented in the PDB You almost have to reach out for that stuff because it doesn t always naturally come up Obama s PDB also increasingly includes information on economic environmental and public health crises that could have an impact on national security And they re not necessarily confined to foreign affairs Last summer deputy press secretary Eric Schultz confirmed that Obama had been briefed on the spread of the Zika virus in Florida as part of his daily intelligence briefing This Aug file photo shows a man crossing This Aug file photo shows a man crossing the CIA logo in the lobby of CIA headquarters in Langley Va Photo Saul Loeb AFP Getty Images World s most exclusive newspaper The President s Daily Briefing also known as the book is among the most secret documents the government keeps For a time even its very existence was thought to be classified It s just one of dozens of products regularly produced by the intelligence community But because it gets the attention of the commander in chief it has a sense of urgency and importance and even mystique that other top secret documents don t have Today it is such a vital part of how the White House operates that one can hardly imagine the modern presidency without it said CIA Director John Brennan as the agency declassified briefings to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson last year The PDB is the most abundantly staffed most deeply sourced daily information service in the world It s been referred to as the world s most exclusive daily newspaper written exclusively for the president of the United States But presidents can and do share the PDB with a small circle of advisers Kennedy never shared his with his vice president Nixon deeply distrusted the CIA and often ignored the briefing instead delegating it to national security adviser Henry Kissinger The younger Bush restricted the distribution to just six or seven people In the Obama administration the distribution list is thought to be as many as two dozen including the secretary of State In her book Hard Choices Clinton called the hand delivered report the first order of business after getting to the office each morning Her schedules released under the Freedom of Information Act often allotted the first five minutes of every morning to reading the PDB The president could even share the briefing with members of his family Trump and his family have denied reports that he s sought security clearances for his children and for son in law Jared Kushner but the president is the ultimate authority on how classified information can be shared and with whom Trump has also raised eyebrows by appearing to question the CIA s integrity in the wake of reports that the spy agency had concluded that Russia deliberately interfered in the election to get Trump elected These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction the Trump transition said in a statement to reporters last week That prompted the White House to defend the intelligence officers and suggest that Trump would do well to listen to them President Obama s experience over the last eight years has been that the men and women of the intelligence community in the United States are patriots White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Monday President Obama is certainly not the first president to

	{ "text": "Congress is preparing to do major battle next month over President elect Donald Trump s secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson in a brewing proxy fight over Trump s potential financial conflicts of interest and his unconventional foreign policy The official sparring is expected to take place on Jan when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee plans to hold a two part hearing to grill Tillerson over his tenure as ExxonMobil s chief executive and what many lawmakers see as unseemly links to Russia But behind the scenes on Capitol Hill the strategizing has already begun Democrats do not think they stand much chance of stopping Tillerson from being confirmed But they plan to press the top diplomat designate to commit to full divestiture from Exxon and detail how he would pursue a different approach to the world as secretary of state in what one Senate Democratic aide who requested anonymity to candidly discuss strategy called a very thorough tough vetting As they have with Trump Democrats plan to focus sharply on potential conflicts of interest deriving from Tillerson s finances as well as his views on critical foreign policy matters It s a grilling they would happily give Trump if only they had reason to drag him before a congressional committee Already the minority party is railing against Republicans for refusing to demand Tillerson produce his tax returns Their frustration stems from Tillerson s response to a routine question about tax returns on the Foreign Relations Committee s pre hearing questionnaire According to a Senate Democratic aide and a Trump transition team spokesman Tillerson said he stood ready to provide only tax return information for himself and his wife for the previous three years That means it s possible Tillerson isn t willing to provide complete returns A battle is brewing over secretary of state designate Rex Tillerson s nomination on Capitol Hill Evan Vucci AP Democrats have demanded that all Trump s Cabinet nominees release their tax returns something Trump himself steadfastly refused to do during the campaign because he said the returns were under routine audit Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker R Tenn said the GOP would not break with years of precedent to compel Tillerson to turn over his tax returns without good reason no matter how loud the clamor from Democrats Unless there was a case where there s some irregularity that s known the committee just does not ask for tax returns Corker said in an interview Corker said Tillerson is not going to be the proxy for Trump because we re not going to ask for tax returns I understand there are a number of Democrats who are very upset about President elect Trump not putting his tax returns Corker said But that s not going to change the way we go about our committee process Senate Democrats believe they can fight miniature versions of the political battles they are waging with Trump during the confirmation hearings for his Cabinet choices particularly those such as Tillerson who hail from the private sector They intend to focus on Tillerson s four decade career at a major oil conglomerate and what they and some Republicans see as questionable ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin Several Democratic members of the committee have said they also plan to ask Tillerson about human rights and climate change in light of his Exxon work Many lawmakers are leaning on Trump to fully divest from his companies because his wide ranging business empire lends itself at the very least to an appearance of conflicts of interest Democrats argue Tillerson s business career raises similar questions Just how thorny those conflicts may be won t be clear until the committee receives Tillerson s financial disclosure statements documents that Corker expects to have before the end of Corker plans to give other committee members a copy of the disclosure as soon as we have it providing ample time to review what is expected to be a very extensive document Committee Democrats are planning to scour Tillerson s financials once they receive them and are exploring options to beef up their resources by borrowing tax and financial experts from other corners of the Hill or seconding Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department employees to help according to an aide The all in effort is vital they argue because unlike many previous secretaries of state Tillerson has not had to publicize details about his personal finances If confirmed Tillerson would be the first secretary of state in decades who has not previously worked as a public servant or a member of the military This proposed nominee for secretary of state will likely be asked more questions than normal Secretary Kerry was somebody that we knew Secretary Clinton was somebody that we knew Corker said Since Tillerson will be up under the hood advising the president on foreign policy a president who hasn t been involved in foreign policy in his business life we certainly want to understand fully the kind of advice he would be giving the president as secretary of state Part of the logic behind planning a two part hearing one session in the morning and one in the afternoon as Corker put it is so there can be plenty plenty plenty of time for people to learn everything they want to from Tillerson A particular point of concern for Democrats and Republicans will be Tillerson s relationship and business dealings with Putin who awarded him the Kremlin s Order of Friendship in Tillerson also opposed sanctions that the United States imposed on Russia in as a reaction to the annexation of Crimea and Moscow s support of separatists in eastern Ukraine arguing that Exxon lost billion from the policy change On Thursday Corker had a minute conversation with Tillerson in which he questioned him about Russia with the bulk of that conversation focusing on sanctions He came away with the impression that Tillerson had no interest in ripping up existing sanctions on Russia even if he criticized them as Exxon s CEO That would be hugely problematic to this one senator if I felt that was how we were going to begin the relations with Russia Corker said referring to himself He noted the conversation alleviated some of the concerns he harbored about Tillerson s relationship with the Kremlin Corker said he encouraged Tillerson to start calling other lawmakers on his committee Tillerson and lead Foreign Relations Committee Democrat Ben Cardin Md also spoke by phone Thursday but a spokesman for Cardin would not detail what was discussed On Tuesday Tillerson was in Washington where he met with Sen Tom Cotton R Ark who endorsed his nomination He hopes to meet with as many senators as possible to discuss his nomination according to the Trump transition team I think at least I hope that when these meetings take place that we re going to see a Rex Tillerson that has a standard view of Russia s malicious activities nefarious activities Corker said I got a good sense of how he d approach Russia and Putin and it was certainly different if you will than the picture of him toasting Putin with champagne Several key GOP senators including John McCain Ariz Lindsey Graham S C and Marco Rubio Fla have expressed concerns that Tillerson s ties to Russia could be a dangerous echo of Trump s seeming affinity for Putin Those concerns have taken on even more urgency in wake of CIA allegations that Russia attempted to tilt the election to Trump Since the president elect selected Tillerson Trump s transition team has been rolling out foreign policy heavyweights such as Bob Gates Condoleezza Rice Stephen Hadley and Dick Cheney to vouch for Tillerson s global bona fides Gates Rice and Hadley run a consulting firm that has Exxon is a client Only one Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee Rubio has publicly criticized Tillerson over his Kremlin ties and he communicated those concerns directly to Corker before the nomination was formally announced Democrats need only persuade one Republican to oppose Tillerson to block his nomination in committee But it is still possible he could get to a floor vote even if the committee rejects him In the past the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has reported out nominations unfavorably a procedure that expresses the members discontent without blocking the full Senate from voting In the full Senate confirmed President Ronald Reagan s Arms Control and Disarmament Agency nominee Kenneth Adelman despite his rejection by the panel But Corker expressed confidence that Tillerson would pass the committee s test even if his track record as an oil company CEO gives members pause My sense is based on the conversation we had he s going to very much understand that his job now is to pursue our country s national interest Corker said ", "label": "pos"},

	{ "text": "HONOLULU President Barack Obama on Tuesday designated the bulk of U S owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing The move helps put some finishing touches on Mr Obama s environmental legacy while also testing President elect Donald Trump s promise to unleash the nation s untapped energy reserves The White House announced the actions in conjunction with the government of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau which also placed a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing in its Arctic waters subject to periodic review Mr Obama is making use of an arcane provision in a law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently The statute says that the president of the United States may from time to time withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf Environmental groups hope the ban despite relying on executive powers will be difficult for future presidents to reverse The White House said it s confident the president s order will withstand legal challenge and said the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals The Atlantic waters placed off limits to new oil and gas leasing are canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia though some had hoped for a more extensive ban that would have extended further south Existing leases aren t affected by the president s executive actions The administration cited environmental concerns in both regions to justify the moratorium Mr Obama also cited the importance of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas in providing subsistence for native Alaskans and the vulnerability of the ecosystem to an oil spill to justify his directive Mr Obama also noted the level of fuel production occurring in the Arctic Mr Obama said just percent of offshore crude production came from the Arctic in and at current oil prices significant production would not occur in future decades That s why looking forward we must continue to focus on economic empowerment for Arctic communities beyond this one sector Mr Obama said Still industry officials objected to Mr Obama s memorandum calling it last minute political rhetoric Instead of building on our nation s position as a global energy leader today s unilateral mandate could put America back on a path of energy dependence for decades to come said Dan Naatz of the Independent Petroleum Association of America And Alaska Gov Bill Walker an independent said Mr Obama s move marginalized local voices He said no one is more invested than Alaskans in making sure Arctic habitats are protected To lock it up against any further exploration or development activity is akin to saying that the voices of activists who live in Lower cities have a greater stake than those to whom the Arctic is our front yard and our back yard he said in a statement In issuing a permanent ban Mr Obama appears to be trying to tie the hands of his successor Mr Trump has vowed a domestic energy revolution and is filling his Cabinet with nominees deeply opposed to Mr Obama s environmental and climate change actions Environmental groups were calling for a permanent ban even before the presidential election but Mr Trump s victory has provided greater urgency for them and for businesses that rely on tourism and fishing Mr Trump has said he intends to use all available fuel reserves for energy self sufficiency and that it s time to open up offshore drilling This decision will help protect existing lucrative coastal tourism and fishing businesses from offshore drilling which promises smaller short lived returns and threatens coastal livelihoods said Jacqueline Savitz a senior vice president at the advocacy group Oceana A key question to be answered is how difficult it will be for future presidents to overturn Mr Obama s decision should they seek to do so The American Petroleum Institute pointed to when President George W Bush used a simple memorandum to remove previously withdrawn lands and make all Outer Continental Shelf lands available for leasing except marine sanctuaries Fortunately there is no such thing as a permanent ban said the institute s Erik Milito But White House officials in a conference call with reporters said previous indefinite withdrawals remain in place and voiced confidence that Mr Obama s decision will stand Advocacy groups were already warning that they were prepared to file suit to protect the ban during future administrations If Donald Trump tries to reverse President Obama s withdrawals he will find himself in court said Marissa Knodel of Friends of the Earth Frank Knapp president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce in Columbia said he was extremely disappointed in the decision not to extend drilling protections to the entire Atlantic seaboard Knapp and his group were among a number of business groups in the southeast who had advocated for banning new drilling leases off their shores arguing that the environmental impacts would hurt fishing tourism and other businesses the region relies upon He d gone to Washington to meet with Obama administration officials and believed the entire Atlantic was to be protected The decision came as Mr Obama spends the holidays in Hawaii Some Democratic lawmakers applauded Obama while some Republicans were highly critical As President elect Trump nominates fossil fuel allies to his Cabinet President Obama has instead put the interests of millions of Americans ahead of those of Big Oil with these permanent protections said Democratic Sen Ed Markey of Massachusetts The extremes to which this president will go to appease special interests never ceases to
